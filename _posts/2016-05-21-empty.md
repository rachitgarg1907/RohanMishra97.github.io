<h2>Empty</h2>
(<i>Poetry, 1 minute read</i>)
<p>Still the same.<br>
The smell of fresh bedsheets,<br>
The mustiness of teakwood,<br>
The air thick with dust and lavender,<br>
The tinkling of cutlery and jingling of bangles--<br>
And the tea flowed into the china cup,<br>
He smiled and edged closer to STAR cricket.<br>
The cooker whistled--hurried footsteps,<br>
The oven switched off with a thung.<br>
The clatter of utensils in the sink,<br>
Tap swooshed,<br>
Squeaky clean, all of it.<br>
Then a shout “SIIIII..IIX”<br>
And claps of a child.<br>
Tick tick tick tong, it’s 10 on the clock<br>
The table made, stands arranged,<br>
‘Colors’ on the screen<br>
Chairs screeched, spoons clattered, tongues click click.<br>
Swooshing of blankets,<br>
Lazy Sunday sun,<br>
Far away cries of buses and seagulls,<br>
“Gitobitan” fluttered on a pair of half-rimmed glasses,<br>
Glasses on the crooked nose of a wrinkled face,<br>
Soft snores mixed with hushed ‘Doraemon’ songs,<br>
Three pairs of eyes,<br>
In a warm winter afternoon,<br>
Droopy, sleepy and wide awake.<br>
Dust fairies swirling,<br>
In front of their remote eyes,<br>
Reflections and reflections,<br>
In it’s rooms and on the photos of those gone,<br>
From under the blanket to on the wall,<br>
The sun was quiet,<br>
And the afternoon cold,<br>
The air mustier, not lavendary though,<br>
The house stays behind cold,<br>
A grave of memories behold.<br>
