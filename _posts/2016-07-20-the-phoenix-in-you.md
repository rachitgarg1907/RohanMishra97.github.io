<h3>The Phoenix in You</h3>
(<i>Poetry,1 minute read</i>)
<p>Right now I am hanging by a thread.<br />
I can travel up but the heat will scorch me or I can fall down into the abyss.<br />
But here in the middle it feels good. There is still hope. No extremities. You would think its good.<br />
But no , it&#39;s even worse. It&#39;s the sweet poison which slowly erodes all your senses and then all you will ever be able to do is just hang there.<br />
But you can make a bold and brave choice.<br />
You can fall down below or you can travel up.<br />
It will surely break you.<br />
But from those pieces, you can build a new you.<br />
It will be difficult.&nbsp;<br />
But it&#39;s a welcome change.&nbsp;<br />
