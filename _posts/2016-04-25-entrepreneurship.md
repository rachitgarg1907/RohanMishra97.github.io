<h2> Entrepreneurship 101 </h2>
(<i>Life, 3 minute read</i>)
<p>Perhaps this is the n-th article you’ve come across on Entrepreneurship . This article is not a stepwise guide to build a billion dollar company. Trust me, this is different.</p>
<p>Many of us want to become entrepreneurs. Starting your own business is one the biggest dreams of our times. But how do you get be an entrepreneur? Most of the advice focuses on the practicalities like writing a business plan, raising money, finding staff, coding, marketing and PR.</p>
<p>We’ll go down a different path.</p>
<p>In our eyes, at the heart of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract: an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness. To be an entrepreneur means, essentially, to become an expert in understanding the things that make life difficult for people. That’s because every properly ambitious business is in some way trying to fix things for other people. And the bigger and more original what you’re trying to fix happens to be, the more your business can prosper.</p>
<p>We live in a society of consumerism and technological advancement. Therefore, it may be easy to think that all the big problems out there already have thousands of fixes anyways. The world doesn’t need a new pizza chain, supermarket, airline industry or e-commerce platform. But to get a sense of the vast opportunities that still remain untapped, all you need to do is ask yourself this: “What causes you unhappiness or unease in the course of an average day?” Every unhappiness is really a new business waiting to be born. Your frustrations are an inexhaustible resource from which the businesses of tomorrow can be built upon. Think of how difficult it is to get on with a long distance relationship, cope with anxiety, educate children... One could go on and on with griefs and frustrations. Thankfully, this provides innumerable opportunities for budding entrepreneurs!</p>
<p>It is, therefore, instrumental to learn from your own unhappiness and trying to find a solution to it. Of course, the practicalities are important! But without a solid insight into the frustrating world of man’s problems, it is impossible to create a successful business. On the flipside, if you have razor sharp insight into the problems of today, and you provide bold solutions, it is really likely that you’ll make it big!</p>
