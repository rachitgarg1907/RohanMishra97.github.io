<h2>Criminals</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>I knock on your door<br>
Hesitant and terrified,<br>
Like a little child caught stealing candy<br>
"Bless me, Father, for i have sinned."<br>
"May the Holy Spirit guide you to the light."<br>
It has, it has. <br>
It has led me to a brilliance-</p>
<p>A point illumination<br>
Raging with fierceness against tides of darkness.<br>
An illumination that lays with me;<br>
Whose rays stain, night after night,<br>
The opposite side of the bed.<br>
A light i've sought<br>
For centuries.</p>
<p>A blind man crawling through time and space<br>
To find this illumination-<br>
This illumination that peeks from behind the eyelids of my significant other<br>
For that's what she is<br>
The yin to my yang<br>
"I've fallen in love, Father."<br>
"That's perfectly natural, my child"<br>
No no no<br>
it isn't. <br>
It's forbidden.<br>
It's verbotten.<br>
It's unnatural.<br>
<p>It's why the Lord will send the apocalypse our way.<br>
There would be destruction.<br>
"We've lain together in Sin, night after night, unbounded by marriage"<br>
"Then you must welcome the ties of Holy Matrimony."<br>
Let our love bleed on paper,<br>
And enrapture the eyes of society.<br>
No holding hands<br>
Behind drawn shades.<br>
Let There Be Light.<br>
Shining on our entwined hands,<br>
And our legs wound around each other<br>
And are lips locked<br>
And breasts crushed between our bodies.<br>
"Father, your Church forbids it"<br>
I'm a woman, and so is the love of my life.<br>
"May the Holy Spirit tie you to the stake, and set it on Fire"</p>
