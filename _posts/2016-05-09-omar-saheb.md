<h2>Omar Saheb-</h2>
(<i>Feel Good, 3 minute </i>
<p>“Congratulations and have a happy retired life!” said the enthusiastic manager to Omar Saheb. “Here’s a token of our appreciation” he chimed in, handing over a memento.</p>

<p>It’s been 4 years since then. The dusted memento,now sits in the corner of the living room, unnoticed. Omar Saheb, as he was called by his juniors had been the head clerk of the State Bank for over 40 years. His family was a happy one, a daughter Tabassum and a son, Rizwaan. His wife, however,had passed away a few years back, leaving behind a lot of memories. </p>

<p>His retired life, was rather dull. He heard no more of the office chatter, no more of the missing signatures, none of the office politics. He was often told that retired life would be relaxing and soothing. It wasn’t. Omar Saheb was going through some crisis he couldn’t understand. Maybe because of the feeling that he was no more the earning member of his middle-class family, maybe because he commanded less respect from his children, maybe because he was getting old: He did not know. And this made life his miserable, he became the grumpy old retired uncle, we all know. He snapped at everyone, he cursed everyone. </p>

<p>His life was now nothing but a schedule to follow, a ritual to obey.Wake up at 6. Practice Yoga for half an hour. Jog in the local park for half an hour. Sip on a cup of insipid tea from Rasheed’s while leafing through The Statesman, oh The Statesman, it had to be. ‘Two killed in a road accident… A scam of 100 crores… A rape.’ The news was always the same. His life, was always the same. </p>

<p>One day, he woke from his bed at sharp 6 AM. The slight pain in his right knee made him groan a little. Just the regular day. Yoga, was just the same, his joints cracked like a piece of biscuit broken in half before they are dipped in a cup of tea. He started jogging: half panting, half sweating. It was then that a woman passed by him, her hands on a pram. He took a peek at what was inside the pram, a baby in a pink dress. The baby smiled at the sweating face of Omar Saheb. It was something different. Something moved inside him. Shaking aside what happened, he kept jogging but couldn’t help thinking about the innocent smile, the reddish tinge in the cheeks of the baby.</p>

<p>At Rasheed’s, he picked up a copy of The Statesman and a cup of piping hot chai. The tea, surprisingly tasted superb! It was sweet, just as he wanted it to be. Rasheed was acting weird, he thought, looking at him. He opened the crisp sheet of newspaper. ‘Indian athlete wins Bronze Medal at Asian Games.. Indian Scientist discovers a way to diagnose Cancer.. The pollution in Delhi decreases, thanks to Odd-Even Rule.’ “That is good news!” he thought. On his way home, all the people he came across were acting different, to him.</p>

<p>At home, Rizwaan was tying his shoelaces, heading to work. He seemed rather joyful when he saw his father. He came close and bid him goodbye, something he hadn’t done in years! When Tabassum came into the room and started massaging the weary legs of Omar Saheb, there was something different in the way that she treated him. </p>


<p>“Today’s everyone seems to act so different to me” he said, seemingly confused and surprised. Tabassum, being the meek little girl that she was, replied “Maybe, it’s because of that sweet smile on your face, Abbu.”</p>
