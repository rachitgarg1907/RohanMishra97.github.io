<h2>Why Travel?</h2>
(<i>Commentary,2 minute read</i>)
<p>Recently, I visited(or more like re-visited, after 15 long years) Dehradun, Mussoorie and Haridwar, and was utterly gobsmacked by the drastic changes that have taken place there. Haridwar resembles a dry commercial oasis(they completely changed the course of the river by building those damn dams!), Mussoorie is utterly crowded and Dehradun resembles Kolkata now. My previous memories of these places were that of people with red cheeks , lush green foliage lining the roads, and hills! As far as your eyes could reach, hills everywhere(except Mussoorie, Dehradun and Haridwar resemble, no scratch that, are flat plains now). And yes! Maggi stalls lining every corner!</p>
<p>My point of sharing this bit of experience was that it’s advisable to visit as many unknown places as you can(these hill stations became a tourist hotspot recently) before their natural beauty’s corrupted by senseless businessmen. Other than that, here’s why you should just pack your bags and set forth-
Have New Experiences- it’s pretty obvious travelling is the best and easiest way to have new experiences, fresh memories, meet new people and cultures, and so on and so forth, thus quenching the pain of that past(if any; one of my reasons of visiting the aforementioned places was to move over someone).</p> 
<p>Helps in Introspection- it’s rightly said that sometimes moving away from things helps you put them into newer perspective, thus helping you lead an improved lifestyle. Also it humbles you enough to realise it’s not all about you.</p>
<p>Educational- pretty much self-explanatory, you learn about new cultures, new places, or even refresh your knowledge about places visited in the past.
A Path to Self-Discovery- facing your fears(if you’re adventurous enough :P), reevaluating your priorities and realizing your true potential, thus empowering you to take on new challenges!</p>
<p>And finally the last and most important point of all</p>
<p>5. Deepening the Bond with our Family and Friends- Again self-explanatory. We all have favourite holiday moments that we’ll cherish forever and ever!
I’d like to end by quoting Mark Twain “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness”.</p>
