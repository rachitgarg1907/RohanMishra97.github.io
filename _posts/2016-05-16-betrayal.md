<h2>Betrayal</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>She was her parentsâ€™ dream Their light, their pride.<br>
They wanted her to shoot for the stars <br>
To achieve all for them The way was one.<br>
She burnt the midnight oil <br>
For she believed <br>
Her destination could<br> 
Bring them happiness.<br>
Finally the day arrived; <br>
She gave the test all she had;<br> 
Came out filled with hope <br>
Finally, the path ends.<br>
The results poured in; <br>
And proudly declared; <br>
That she had failed.<br>
Her father turned around<br> 
Blood splurting out of his back<br> 
For the dagger had cut deep <br>
He turned around and saw <br>
Those familiar eyes.<br>
His eyes were filled with horror<br> 
As the dagger trembled in her hands.<br> 
He screamed and his voice <br>
Woke her up<br>
Has she betrayed her own parents;<br> 
All wrong was only her fault. <br>
The door opened, he rushed in <br>
And the same horror returned.<br>
She did betray him; <br>
For when he moaned on the ground;<br> 
She hung in the air <br>
Silent, lifeless.<br>
