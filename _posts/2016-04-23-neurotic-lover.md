<h2>Another Neurotic Lover</h2>
(<i>Weird, 2 minute read</i>)
<p>"I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; <br>
I lift my lids and all is born again. <br>
I think I made you up inside my head.”</p>
<p>I thought we had something. Remembering my preferences, empathizing, listening to me, and thus breaking my guard down. You pried me open, and I happily welcomed you into my little world. Where have those times gone?</p>
<p>“I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed <br>
And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. <br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)”</p>
<p>Times spent with you felt like a dream. You made me feel stronger, and weaker at the same time. Excited and anxious, simultaneously. I started obsessing over you. My lips turned up only when they formed your name. I blew my caution to the wind and fell head-over-heels for you.</p>
<p>“I fancied you'd return the way you said, <br>
But I grow old and I forget your name. <br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)”</p>
<p>It was spring-time in my stomach whenever your lips caressed my name. You imprinted yourself to the very mire of my being. Perfection and you went hand-in-hand. And now, it seems that you’re moving on, leaving me all messed up. The notion of life without you seems to wind me up like when you slip on the stairs and one of the steps hits you in the middle of the back. You were too good to be true, that even your imperfections were mine. I put you on a pedestal, and worshipped you like a fanatic, never noticing all the while that I was falling apart myself in the process.</p>
<p>“I should have loved a thunderbird instead; <br>
At least when spring comes they roar back again.”</p>
<p>I tell myself time and again to move on, to let go of you, find someone who reciprocates those flowery sentiments. But I’m really messed up to even believe if someone could be even better than you. I keep repeating that you’re just a mere infatuation, but in vain. I’d sell my soul to the devil to get those times back.
Sometimes, I curse you for making me feel so vulnerable. Those feelings of ‘love’ turn to despise instantaneously, but then I bang my head against the wall and lament that it was perhaps all my fault. You have such a power over me, I sometimes wonder whether you were just a figment of my imagination. Maybe obsessing over you seems more exciting than living the real life.</p>
