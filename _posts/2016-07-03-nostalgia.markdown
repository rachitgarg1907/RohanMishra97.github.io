<h2>Nostalgia</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>A single moment, trapped in cellulose<br>
Or a scent your nose never forgets. <br>
A taste of your beloved or<br>
Some view you shared with someone<br>
Who is no longer there.</p>

<p>Memories seep through,<br>
Emotions hit as pulses,<br>
Then as waves<br>
Washing you over the cliff.</p>

<p>They find their way<br>
Through your eyes<br>
Drops turning to waterfall<br>
You relive it as it once was.</p>

<p>Remembrance at times high or low<br>
Is a terrible thing to bear.<br>
Look forward; don’t cling on to past.<br>
For that’s how you fare.</p>
