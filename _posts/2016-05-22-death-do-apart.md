<h2>Till Death do us apart</h2>
(<i>Thriller. 4 minute read</i>)
<p>“C’mon, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em tiger, get down on your knees, get down on your knees again…”</p>
<p>Crooning along with Alex Turner, she arranges the red carnations in the vase and places them over the dining table. Taking an off from work, she’d been slaving all over the house today, her husband was finally returning after a month-long business trip. She wanted everything to be perfect– from cooking his favourite food, accompanied with a bottle of Shiraz and preparing the bath-tub with his favourite scents for him to relax.</p>
<p>She hated the way they’d left things before he’d departed for the airport– they’d gotten into a terrible fight, one culminating into physical and emotional abuse. The reason for the spat was that she’d recently gotten a job offer in New York– as an editor at Random House. It meant better pay, better lifestyle, but that also meant moving away from San Francisco; the place where her husband was running a small media publishing house successfully. Naturally Shaun didn’t want to move away from all that he’d built, and didn’t want her to go as well. Obviously she started accusing him of not letting her move ahead in life, holding her back, not letting her live out her dream. He argued right back that she has everything a woman could possibly want out of life– a successful marriage, a house with a white picket fence and sufficient money to live out rest of their lives. Of course, vicious profanities were exchanged, leading to a dogfight between the two of them. It ended with her hitting him over the head with a poker, and he promptly passed out on the living room carpet. She got really scared, but after a few minutes, he regained consciousness, completely ignored her, took his bags and left for the airport.</p>
<p>Feeling remorseful for her actions, and thinking that maybe Shaun was right– they have everything(what’s an editor’s post at some stupid publication compared to this?)– she vowed to make it up to him when he returned, and to always agree with his decisions, and never to counter-argue with him. After all, isn’t it a woman’s duty to keep a house together?</p>
<p>Finishing up with the remaining chores, she went to the guest room to freshen up. Coming out an hour later, she was surprised to see a suitcase lying near the front door.</p>
<p>Her eyes teared up a bit. "He's back!", she wailed to herself and went off searching for him. She went straight to his study to see him resting in the arm-chair in front of the fireplace, his back towards her direction.</p>
<p>She looked at him and beamed, a first true smile gracing her face after he’d left a month ago. </p>
<p>Assuming that he was sleeping and not wanting to wake him up, she tiptoed near him and just had a long look at him.</p>
<p>His eyes were closed, but the expression was one of agony. His complexion looked pasty and he didn’t seem to be breathing.</p>
<p>She caressed his head slowly, putting her hand over his head and sitting on her knees, next to him. His skin felt clammy and cold. </p>
<p>She cooed in his ear, "Wake up, Shaun."</p>
<p>He didn’t even seem to budge.</p>
<p>She continued whispering and caressing him, hoping that maybe even in his dreams, he'd be able to hear her call. And her siren’s call would bring him back to her.</p>
<p>He didn't seem to wake up. </p>
<p>Violently nudging him, she started crying uncontrollably. His body dropped on the mat, the face illuminated by the fire. </p>
<p>She thought after all that pretense, after concocting the damn dream-like story, he’d finally respond, and they’d be able to live out their happily ever after. 
She went with the submissive housewife this time, knowing how much guys like him dig passive and docile women. </p>
<p>But he simply refused to wake up. The gashes made by stabbing him multiple times by a kitchen knife were starting to open up again. </p>
<p>She hated the expression on his face, and thought of melting more wax and “sculpting” a newer, happier face this time around.</p>
<p>She felt for his faint heartbeat, reassuring herself that he was still on the brink of life.</p>
<p>“Oh Shaun, you’re starting to smell again. Let me get the perfume. Now sit tight and don’t go crawling away anywhere, love. As if you can.” Wiping her tears off, she went out of the study.</p>
<p>Shaun lay there, immobile.</p>
<p>He couldn’t even twitch his fingers, he was just a mere spectator to the bizarre experiments conducted on him. He was, as she called it, her life-sized doll. It was all child’s play to her. When she said she wanted to role play, he never knew this was what she had in mind.</p>
<p>Ever after being stabbed more than a few times, all those years ago. He lay there, in the basement, immobile, dead. But not dead. His body was decomposing, but his mind was still intact. He had no idea how. When she realised he was still alive after 2 days she was ecstatic. Now he was reduced to her “mere puppet”.
He tried escaping this place a gazillion times, but in vain. Whoever thought she’d turn out to be one heck of a lunatic when they got married.</p>
<p>Every time he thought that life was finally going out of him, she’d nurse him back to health. And begin the torture process all over again.
He wished that he would’ve just died when Annalise stabbed him, all those years ago. </p>
<p>She was his mistress.</p>
<p>He was helplessly undead. </p>
<p>A happy couple indeed. </p>
<p>-Shreya.</p>
