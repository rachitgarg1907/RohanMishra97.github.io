<h3>Happiness is</h3>
(<i>Poetry,1 minute read</i>)
<p>Bright, pink.<br />
Fluffy, moist and lovely,</p>

<p>Filled with air ,<br />
within and without.<br />
A fleeting sweet taste,<br />
a scarlet tongue&nbsp;<br />
And sticky gums.</p>

<p>A cotton candy for two,<br />
Or one, the memory of two.<br />
A beach walk in July,<br />
Drenched clothes<br />
And Sticky hair.<br />
