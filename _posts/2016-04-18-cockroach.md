<h2>Through the eyes of a Cockroach</h2>
(<i>Weird,2 minute read</i>)
<p>Crawling up the sewers, tunnel by tunnel, I finally enter the house of Mr. Sharma, through the circular holes of a sink in the dark kitchen. Being slithery beings, it’s comparatively easy for the likes of us to enter a place through such entrances. A cockroach, is something that people have polarized views about. It terrifies some and is the subject of experiment of others. Fortunately, I have been lucky enough to come in contact with the former category of people.</p>
<p>The lights of the kitchen suddenly turn on. I look up to see Mr. Sharma’s daughter Sandhya, holding a pest repellent, searching for cockroaches, just like me. I try to conceal myself but sadly, get spotted by her. She frantically tries to spray the poison on me, but I escape just in time, thanks to my ability to fly, that has gotten me out of many tough spots. Humans, always trying to poison us to death, mostly succeed. It gives them an ego boost and they consider themselves to be the superior being until we start flying ... And sometimes getting decapitated in the process. A bad thing you say?</p>
<p>See, the great thing about losing our heads sometimes, is that we still survive the ordeal to tell our brethren, later on, all about it. The only downside is, well, we are left literally brainless.So, it’s sort of a trade-off. Furthermore, I’m not trying to sound arrogant but, cockroaches are capable of surviving being bombarded by nuclear weapons, and that’s a pretty big thing even for human beings. Also, the best thing about being a “vermin” is that we can survive for weeks by just having a day’s meal, assuming we don’t die of infection or any other disease.</p>
<p>But then, not everything is so great. We sometimes lose count of the number of children and sadly, don’t remember having them sometimes. It’s a terrible life to live by, but we somehow make it. It’s always fascinating to see, people, like Mr. Sharma’s family are so obsessed with the unimportant things like appearances, and getting extremely saddened when it’s not appreciated, even though they are fully capable of being fantastic worker beings. I guess in that aspect really, humans are behind than most beings walking this planet.</p>
<p>Well, for a cockroach, I do think a lot, but what can I say, I’ve been always told that I’m smart.</p>
<p>I can’t help it really. Sometimes I think I’m not meant to be this being, that I’m destined to be something else. But then, I’m a cockroach, what do I know?
At the end of the day, I just get a little bit tired and crawl back through the same hole and just run back to my family, following the same path as always. Interestingly, it never gets boring. Not a bad life to live in my opinion.</p>
