<h2>Nietzsche</h2>
(<i>Philosophy, 2 minute read</i>)
<p>I distinctly remember the day when my aunt gave me a book. The kind of book that changes lives and brings a different perspective of thought. It was called ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ by some military looking moustached philosopher named Friedrich Nietzsche. I have been fascinated by his works ever since.</p>
<p>Greek culture was governed by two primary gods: Apollo and Dionysius. Apollo is the god of thought and reason. He encompasses the area wisdom,calm,reason and logical thinking. But then for Nietzsche, there is this other god who is exactly the opposite. He is about chaos, emotion and impulse. The Dionysian encompasses the expanse of runaway emotions, sexuality and impetuosity.</p>
<p>The opposition between the both,runs right through the Greek culture and infact through all of us. We all are half beings of reason and logic and half dancing, frenzied impulsive creatures. Ironically, Greek culture started to go wrong when they began to forget about Dionysius. Nietzsche believed the Greek culture became too Apollonian, because of philosophy in general and Socrates in particular. They fell in love with the idea of controlling everything through their minds. They turned against drinking wine and unreason. It was deeply wrong and brought their demise. And real wisdom comes with us accepting our Dionysian side.</p>
<p>There’s this side of us that wants to understand. That longs for calm and wisdom. Then there’s this side of us that drawn to darkness,chaos, sexuality and madness. He was very unphased by all of this and he commands it to accept both of it and maintain the balance between the forces within us.
We are grateful to him for letting us realize what’s within us and gauge at how incredibly complex is the business of being human.</p>
