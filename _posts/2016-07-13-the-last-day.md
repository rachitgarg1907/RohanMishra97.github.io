<h3>The Last Day</h3>
(<i>Poetry,1 minute read)
<p>He lay there silently underneath the debris
Not a sound could he afford to make
Sand had deep penetrated his lungs
But his brain functioned just fine
Terrorists had not spared even the remotest of cities</p>
<p>His city, in USA, his first home since 2004
Now as he lay there amidst the dust and stench
5 days it had been
Bodies of the deceased rotting in all glory
Neither food, nor water in his destiny
He prepared to die soon
But his brain kept asking the same question</p>
<p>Iterated it a thousand times, as far as he could recollect
What was his mistake, he wondered?
He couldn&rsquo;t bear to forget that class
That maths lecture by Ms. Clare</p>
<p>The one that changed his whole mind set, his life
&ldquo;I am the son of Allah&rdquo;, he used to proclaim with pride
Eyes gleaming with ecstasy!
Little did he know, these words would invite despair
The professor wasn&rsquo;t mincing her words</p>
<p>She called the poor boy, a terrorist
His tender heart burst into a million pieces
He hadn&rsquo;t wronged anyone ever
Neither had such intentions</p>
<p>Then why would she say such cold words?
That was the last day he ever smiled
Last day he ever felt proud of being a Muslim
His friends were no longer his friends
Solitude was his newfound companion</p>
<p>They teased him everyday
So much so that he dropped out of school
These things didn&rsquo;t matter now, though
It was time for him to embrace Azrael</p>
<p>His life hadn&rsquo;t been a happy one
Contemplating over the strange turns it took
He couldn&rsquo;t help but mutter something strange to himself
He was Khan but certainly not a terrorist!</p>
