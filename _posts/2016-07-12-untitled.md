<h2>Untitled</h2>
<p><em>(Poetry)</em></p>
<p>
Here I am again<br />
Quill in hand, a diary in front<br />
Ready to pen down</p>
<p>A new testament<br />
To my worry and woes<br />
To my insecurities and lows<br />
To all that I fear and also hold dear</p>

<p>To the one that got away and to the one whom I let go<br />
The clock starts to tick<br />
Thoughts don&rsquo;t leave the crevices of my brain<br />
And seep onto the page</p>

<p>To paint the pictures that I think<br />
The smoke goes stale, of the last drag that I missed thinking of you<br />
Trying to find my muse in you<br />
Trying to muster up a rhyme from your being</p>

<p>Trying hard! To find words.<br />
Then it dawns upon me; my subjects are long dead<br />
My verses are idle and repressed<br />
And me? Stuck, the same place as yesterday</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s this occasional misfit to do?<br />
Should I not feel?<br />
No. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t<br />
Know that nostalgia&rsquo;s not for me; for I&rsquo;ll never</p>

<p>Let go.<br />
Should I not think?<br />
No. It&rsquo;s what I do<br />
That defines my self for you</p>

<p>To consume.<br />
Should I just give up?<br />
No. For some fights are better fought<br />
When you&rsquo;re about to lose.</p>

<p>So, here I am; a little bitter,<br />
A little better.<br />
Ready for another battle.<br />
Quill in hand, a diary in front</p>

<p>Ready to pen down<br />
A new testament.<br />
