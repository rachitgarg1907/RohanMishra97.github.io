<p>At the stroke of the midnight hour&quot;,<br />
she shed out her skirt<br />
and, he devoured the torso.<br />
Their eyes hardly met<br />
and only bodies scratched each other<br />
till her soul was ripped apart<br />
for a meal or a drink.<br />
In this hungry world,<br />
One hunger annuls the other.</p>
