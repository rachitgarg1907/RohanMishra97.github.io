<h2>QUEEN.</h2> 
<p>I'm six years old, it's getting cold... <br>
I have my blazer on..<br>
I see you smile and look up in those shining eyes.. I run and run along the light towards you shown.....<br>
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home..</p>

<p>I'm fifteen now and with those friends so mean, I had a fight..<br>
Leaving all your problems you came to tell me, you'll always be here for all my life...</p>

<p>I'm eighteen now, I don't know who I am going to talk to at college..<br>
But I know I am laughing on the car drive with You, by the window edge..</p>

<p>I wish I could turn back time to good simple days when you sang me to sleep..<br>
But now this world makes me weep..</p>

<p>So I take this chance to say ; <br>
Everyday I become a little more like you..<br>
That neverending love I have, you will never have a clue...<br>
Thank you for being the life line you have always been...<br>
Mom, you will always be a little above any QUEEN!!</p>
