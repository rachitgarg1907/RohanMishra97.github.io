<h3>Shh come here!</h3>
(<i>Fiction,3 minute read</i>)
<p>I could hear the sound of the burning wood, breaking the silence where I stood. Even the crickets were awfully quiet, and the trees refused to sway like they used to before. I was thinking about someone I met the day before.</p>
<p>Our eyes met in the intense cacophony of the bustling bus. She stood there, a few feet away from me, grabbing on to the hand rest above her, dictating something to an old woman seated below. It seemed like a list that went something like</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Cucumber, 3 kilos</li>
	<li>Radish, half-a</li>
	<li>Potatoes, 6 kilos</li>
</ul></p>
<p>I ceased to listen after that. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t care about what she said, I was too mesmerized by her voice. The sweet melody made me a bit numb, I felt like I was a ragdoll, resting on a pole, about to fall at any moment. I swear if her voice turned stern right then, my insides would burn, because I felt like a Voodoo Child and she, A black magic woman.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I doubt she noticed our eyes were fixated on each other. I was tempted to just say that &ldquo;She&rsquo;s SO nice!&rdquo;, because that&rsquo;s exactly what my mind was shouting at the top of it&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>When she became aware that our eyes were locked together, she looked away promptly. I could feel that she felt uneasy. A few pot-holes and a head bump later, I found myself apologizing to her, my face having an eerily wide smile.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, she didn&#39;t seem to notice that, but then her eyes held a tinge of grey in them. That didn&#39;t seem to diminish her beauty. We were both busy, talking about everything. I told her that I wasn&#39;t from the city and she told me that she&#39;s been here for 25 years. &nbsp;That&#39;s the only personal information we exchanged, I think. I could feel that she understood what I was saying. That felt good.</p>


<p>I don&#39;t know what happened in between, but before I could realize, I was already in her bed, lying next to her slowly aging body, wide eyed, listening to the squeaks of the slowly revolving fan. She loud snores did help to fill the otherwise silent room. Getting up, I decided to make some coffee for her, as that did seem appropriate.</p>

<p>I instantly regretted the decision to have done what I did because it seemed really obvious that it was a one time affair that wasn&#39;t going to last. Also, I felt a tingling sensation deep down that somehow what I did was gravely wrong. I tried diverting my thoughts and focus on the now, as often my psychiatrist told me to.</p>

<p>The refrigerator had all sorts of pictures , the ones had children, probably hers, multiple men and paintings that evoked feelings of longing and loneliness. Or maybe that was just how I felt.</p>

<p>One picture though, brought on a sense of familiarity. The woman holding a baby, young enough to be the same age as my 2 year old, having a bright smile on her face. She looked considerably young. But the baby had eerily similar features as to his son and that disturbed me a bit. Comparing pictures unsettled me even more. Still trying to stop my imagination from running wild, I took a seat by the kitchen window, and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not what you think it is, this is not what you think it is. Just a coincidence, calm down&quot;, I kept on chanting these words to myself.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on hearing the fridge door open, my eyes darted towards that direction. I saw her, still naked, leaning on, searching for something.</p>

<p>Almost uncontrollably, I started asking her trivial questions related to her life, like if she was an alcoholic, had trust issues, run away from home at the age of 22 to elope with someone, and then leaving him and his son, abruptly, when things didn&#39;t seem to work out.</p>

<p>Finally, I asked for her first husband&#39;s name. On hearing what she said, I was still unsure because coincidences do happen and this might&#39;ve been one, but I didn&#39;t want to know more. Quickly grabbing onto my belongings, I exited her house, without saying goodbye. A tinge of guilt had taken over me and I wanted to forget it as soon as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But then, I don&#39;t know what happened, instead of making it straight to the station, I decided to roam around the city, knowing very well that my train left in 5 hours.</p>

<p>With 15 minutes remaining, I decided to go where I was a day ago now, a park by the railway station.</p>

<p>I could hear the sound of the burning wood, breaking the silence where I stood. Even the crickets were awfully quiet, and the trees refused to sway like they used to before. I could see her at a distance from where I stood, moonlight making her wrinkled body shine.</p>

<p>I should leave now, I thought. I shouldn&#39;t be here, this is fucked up.</p>

<p>But then, a part of me was shouting, &quot;fucked up is good. You love fucked up. You don&#39;t regret what you did a bit!&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t block it anymore. I knew I wasn&#39;t blocking the feelings of guilt or regret, I was blocking the intense lust for the woman.</p>

<p>I ran. Hard. Fast. Towards what I thought I deserve, forgetting about everything that was in this world. I ran towards her.</p>
