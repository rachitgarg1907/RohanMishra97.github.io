<h2>Damned United</h2>
(<i>Commentary, 4 minute read</i>)
<p>While talking to one of my friends about football(as usual), I was reminded of this movie, The Damned United, and consequently of one of the greatest football rivalries the English League has ever witnessed– that of Don Revie and Brian Clough.</p>
<p>Revie at that time was managing Leeds(and his success at Leeds let him to win managerial posting for the English National team), while Clough led Derby County. Clough was a fierce critic of Revie, mainly due to his vehement and physical style of play that he’d adopted for Leeds. Later, Clough succeeded Revie as manager of Leeds, the most powerful club in British football(back then). Having fancied his chances of doing Revie’s job even better, he tells the team to discard the many medals they had won, accusing them of gamesmanship and winning ugly. Johnny Giles, then star player of Leeds, still recalls vividly his disbelief, and that of his team-mates, when Clough advised them to throw all their medals into the nearest dustbin. "It didn't make sense. We were the champions, and like all players in every situation we were committed to doing well. Clough had had his success and whatever he had said about us in the past, we imagined he would be as keen as us for the club to succeed.” The team got off to a disastrous string of results, ultimately leading to Clough leaving, just 44 days after he joined.</p>
<p>For all the uncanny parallels of their journeys from the poor streets of Middlesbrough, including the pride that came when they played for England, Brian Clough and Don Revie did indeed become locked in a rivalry marked by contempt and, in the end, something that could not be distinguished from outright hatred.</p>
<p>Quite true. Usually when managers are shown the door, they go underground, and are not to be heard from in weeks (*cough* David *cough* Moyes). But Clough headed straight from Elland Road(that’s the Leeds stadium, for those who aren’t familiar) to the Yorkshire TV Studios, where he was interviewed by Austin Mitchell, along with Don Revie. And to think a sour loser would stay mum, think again.</p>
<p>Revie had his own share of misadventures, mainly with the management of the English National team, to the extent of him not working for football in his home country, and spending the rest of his career in the Middle East, where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Clough meanwhile took up the managerial position at Nottingham Forest, and repeating Derby’s exploits, helped them win the First Division. Quoting Clough, “resignations are for prime ministers and those caught with their trousers down, not for me”. Unquote.</p>
<p>To my generation, the Wenger-Mourinho rivalry might seem like a more entertaining one(it is though; remember that pitch-side spat during Chelsea versus Arsenal?). But their rivalry is more hilarious than downright frosty, unlike Revie-Clough, which got every football fanatic emotionally invested(damn that 70’s show).</p>
