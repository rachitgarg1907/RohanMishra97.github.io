<h3>Fear</h3>
(<i>Poetry,2 minute read</i>)
<p>For he has conquered all,<br />
Seldom has he tasted defeat.</p>

<p>All who have bowed down&nbsp;<br />
To his triumph,<br />
Have lost all,<br />
Pride, love, life.</p>

<p>For he conquers every being,<br />
Be it men in the battle,&nbsp;<br />
The innocent held hostage,&nbsp;<br />
Or the girl standing outside&nbsp;<br />
Her examination hall.</p>

<p>He plays around with her,<br />
When she walks in the dark,<br />
He smiles at her,&nbsp;<br />
When she looks for acceptance<br />
In the eyes of her peers.</p>

<p>He strangles her when alone,<br />
While footsteps follow her,<br />
When the family she loved,&nbsp;<br />
Sets her on fire.</p>

<p>But once he looks into her eyes,<br />
And can&#39;t see himself amidst.<br />
The moment she declares,<br />
She shall have the last laugh.</p>
