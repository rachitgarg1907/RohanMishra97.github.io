<p>He sits alone,<br />
looking at the window hung on the wall.<br />
He weaves his own griefs,<br />
makes them his own<br />
as if all sadness is his;<br />
sheds tears of words over it<br />
and amasses it in a bucket with ink.<br />
He&#39;s never harmed anyone&#39;s sleep<br />
for advice, or hugs or kisses.<br />
They say he&#39;s a poet.<br />
