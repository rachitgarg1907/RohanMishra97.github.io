<h3>When The Fuckboy Falls in Love</h3>
(<i>Fiction,3 minute read</i>)
<p>&quot;As she bit my lip, I let out a small hiss through my teeth. Should I, should I not? I gripped her tighter. I think I should. So I made my hands go further down the slight curve of her body trying to stop where I wanted to.<br />
And I was stupefied by an unsettling realisation. I went with the shouldn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t put my hands over the swell of her chest.&nbsp;<br />
Just a little squeeze of her tiny waist and I mentally laughed for me, Nakul Sachdev, a guy who never thought twice before starting a hot make out with my hands all over the girl&#39;s assets, was now rejoicing in the little curves of this girl&#39;s waist. She had ignited in me a lust, a lust so new it dripped with a longing of her presence and presence only. No hanky-panky, no dirty businesses. Just her, sitting, singing in her husky voice, or merely laugh at the silliest of my jokes with her slight body cosied up in the car seat beside me. I don&#39;t even mind her feet being up, the black thread anklet being the centre of my attention ignoring all the childhood scars she was so afraid to show.<br />
Her innocence would have an effect so profound on me, I never knew.</p>

<p>Being her first kiss is glorious enough, I won&#39;t let myself go down the same old routine I share with the girls I&#39;ve had. Not with this one. She is a woman<br />
A true woman. And I&#39;ll wait for her. (Her begging me is also a fantasy though).&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone of you is knowledgeable enough to understand this new terminology seeing it has taken the social media like a storm. Fuckboy. For those of you not that fortunate, it means a male who acts, lies, cheats, enacts, pretends to be someone else, has multiple identities and alibis, all in the aim of getting into a girl&#39;s pants.<br />
Nowadays, the increase in number of short term relationships or as we call them, friends with benefits; the new wave of online dating; polygamy when the other person doesn&#39;t know about it (for laymen, cheating) have conditioned the heads of girls to a level that even a guy asking the directions to a place with a smile on his face will be tagged as a fuckboy for any lady. Maybe he is that, maybe he loves this life and the sense of freedom it provides him. And obviously, it&#39;s a small world and the reputations of this category of men follows them everywhere.<br />
The real complication occurs when this gentleman actually falls in love. The reputation won&#39;t help you now, will it? And a girl, no matter how naive she is and how this guy is a dream for her and how she is head over heels for this guy, won&#39;t give in, won&#39;t ever trust him when he confesses his feelings for you. It might be another act to aid him to get into her pants. So what do we do now?<br />
The answer is simple. Do what you never did boy, befriend her. The idea of taking someone out for a coffee or pancakes is so bizarre for us that the amazing outcomes of these 3 hours you spend without looking at your phones have obliterated from our minds. Loving someone means loving the person in front of you, not the girls he did it with, not the people he met, not the number of swipes he got on Tinder. It is just a leap of faith girls, you need to overcome your fears. Also, there is always an option of going diabolical and setting his house on fire if he does what you feared.</p>

<p>So I will stick to this, you will not find the better half unless you have at least three failed relationships. And what if he was a fuckboy indeed. You made him stop, you made him leave the lifestyle he adopted for years, you made him concentrate on one centre of his universe, and that&#39;s you, take pride in that, keep your head high and go for it. It is okay to let go. In this bedlam of a universe, it is only you who can protect yourself and only you who will harm yourself. Hence, what will be your golden word? Happiness or Conjecture? I leave it to you.</p>
