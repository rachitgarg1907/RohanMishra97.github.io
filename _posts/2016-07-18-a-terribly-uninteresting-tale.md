<h3>A Terribly Uninteresting Tale</h3>
(<i>Fiction,3 minute read</i>)
<p>People. People everywhere. Look to the right, left, ahead, backwards, upwards, everywhere just people. It&rsquo;s terribly annoying to be around people sometimes. If there are so many people, the voices get jumbled up and all you hear is a not so gentle hiss and hum of different voices, juxtaposed together. It&rsquo;s difficult to eavesdrop conversations when you cannot hear comprehensible phrases. Terrible.<br />
So, I sit on a bench, near an intersection. It&rsquo;s around 6 o&#39; clock in the evening, and there are literally a hundred people around me. There&rsquo;s a friend with me, and he too is talking, but I can&rsquo;t hear him.&nbsp;<br />
I&rsquo;m searching for someone.&nbsp;<br />
She&rsquo;ll be here, I think to myself. I have to do this today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been contemplating about talking to this one girl for the past few days. Okay, I admit, a year, to be exact. Every time I see her, hell, every time I see any new girl that I like, I freeze and am unable to talk. I&rsquo;ve researched about it, but I think it&rsquo;s a disease. The internet tells me it&rsquo;s a mental construct of some sort, but you can&rsquo;t believe everything that&rsquo;s on the internet, can you now?</p>

<p>I look at my wrist watch. The smaller dial is on 6 and the larger one is somewhere between 5 and 10. Feeling agitated, I start stomping my foot on the ground continually, much to the annoyance of the girl standing next to me. I look up to her.&nbsp;<br />
I notice she has black hair tied up like a bun, she&rsquo;s wearing this unusually dark pinkish coloured tee, a strand of her hair falling right in front of her left eye. Her face is beautifully constructed, I observe but the expression she has is really not that pleasing. She&rsquo;s talking to someone on her phone and looking at me at the same time, the same look I get from my mother when I do something stupid.&nbsp;<br />
I look down and stop stomping my foot. Then I contemplate about all the stupid things I&rsquo;ve ever done.&nbsp;<br />
A snap of my friend&rsquo;s fingers brings back my consciousness. I look up to see him looking at me, inquisitively. His unusually wrinkly eyes pry on mine, almost invading my personal space.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;We have to go, it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo; he replies.<br />
&ldquo;Yes yes, wait, she&rsquo;ll be here, then we&rsquo;ll go&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Damn it, I can&rsquo;t stay here. Looking at so many pretty girl depresses me&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Then go talk to one&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Like you can&rdquo; he says, rolling his eyes.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I will, today. Just let her come&rdquo; I say, my eyes, probably, are beaming.<br />
He stands up and walks towards a shady looking corner. I don&rsquo;t notice where he goes.&nbsp;<br />
Now my eyes search for her. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m patient right now, hell I&rsquo;m panicking like something. A deer, or zebra, waiting for a lion to pounce on it.&nbsp;<br />
Suddenly, the whole space that my eyes can look at turns red. Completely. I can&rsquo;t see because it&rsquo;s out of focus. On shutting them tight and opening them, I notice a red bus has invaded my vision. I see that it goes to my locality. I look to where my friend stood a minute before to see he&rsquo;s walking towards the bus.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Hey, wait, she might come!&rdquo; I say&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m going&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Wait up&rdquo; I say, but not before I inspect my surroundings, one last time.</p>

<p>Then I see her, with three of her friends, walking merrily, she&rsquo;s wearing this light-ish blue tee that just makes her stand out from the bland colours around her. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t even notice her friends.<br />
But then my mind decides to plot against me.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know who you are, stop thinking and get on the bus&rdquo;, it says.&nbsp;<br />
I never think logically when it comes love, but right now, I feel my brain is right. I have no right to be around her, she doesn&rsquo;t care. She doesn&rsquo;t know me.&nbsp;<br />
I step on the bus, hanging right by the edge, looking on as she walks away from me. I contemplate getting off, but just at that moment, the bus starts.&nbsp;<br />
I sigh and fully get inside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll talk to her tomorrow&rdquo;, my mind consoles me.&nbsp;<br />
I wish I would, I think.</p>
