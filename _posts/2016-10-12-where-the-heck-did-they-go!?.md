<h3>Where the heck did they go!?</h3>
(<i>Fiction,5 minute read</i>)
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;, I curse under my breath, as I saw the other &ldquo;ear&rdquo; of my earphones rendered useless, marmalized by my own carelessness, I realise, seeing the tangled mess in my hands. Now, I had no shit to do except stare at the blank, defeated, excited, but again, tired, relieved too faces of my fellow metro riders. I saw a little girl trying to push a man&rsquo;s bag away to get a seat on the floor. Guilt-ridden, I offered her mine, sitting down back again as I saw her shaking her head, a NO. &ldquo;He gave me these super-comfy heels man, just so that I don&rsquo;t feel short! I love him!&rdquo;, chirped a girl two maybe three years younger to me, distracting me from the little girl. I think it&rsquo;s just so that he doesn&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;re short, my sarcastic subconscious spoke in my head, making me laugh inwardly. Nevertheless, I glanced at her heels, and they told me a different story altogether. Shoe Bites, boils on the front and cuts on ankle, &ldquo;Leave the shoes bro, leave the freak show you&rsquo;re going out with! Go out with me?&rdquo;. Damn! the subconscious was on fire, I cognized, looking at the pretty girl with round eyes that could melt you from within but- Ok, stop right there.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a wave of nostalgia hit me and a faint memory of Ma cleaning my shoes came to my head. &ldquo;Do not say that shoes are not important just because they are on your feet. Keep them prim and proper, it&rsquo;s the shoes that tell the reality in this caked world.&rdquo; Oh well, bang on yet again woman, I miss you. The lovestruck girl&rsquo;s friend seemed clearly irritated with her friend&rsquo;s obsession for her boyfriend. I looked down at her feet, white shoes that looked highly comfortable but were in a mess so deep only freckles of white were visible on them. Her careless attire of slovenly tucked shirt and jeans was true to her footwear, I deduced.</p>

<p>My quest ensued, I went from gladiators to slip-ons till leather brogues and again, I stopped on a pair of feet to broad to belong to a woman, but the footwear was definitely of a woman, since those were easily the most expensive pair of heels in the whole bogey. I shot a glance right up to the wearer&rsquo;s face, who instantly noticed it. It was a boy, alright, who got truly uncomfortable because of my impolite staring. I tried to manage a smile but it did no good as my eyes betrayed me and I stole a glance again. Now, he caught me. And I started looking at my lap, shifting uncomfortably in my seat when a clear, beautiful voice said, &ldquo;Go on, ask me. I know you want to.&rdquo; I looked up, it was the same guy but the voice? Balderdash escaped my throat, nothing else. &ldquo;They are Dior, I was checking you out before, seeing everyone&rsquo;s feet, judging their lives, it is something I do too. But that&#39;s not what you wanted to know mmh? I am a girl, geez, &nbsp;look at me closely, I am too cute to be a guy&rdquo;, she winked at me. And I surmised that except her sorry haircut and almost flat chest and unisex clothing, she indeed was a girl. I murmured an apology and she got down the next stop, and I mused, smiling, that Ma was truly right, even a person&#39;s clothing befuddled me about their sex, only the footwear was true. Jeez.</p>

<p>But my footwear? Simple rubber slippers under a proper kurta and jeans was highly inappropriate and axiomatically suggested my laziness as I was already late for my first class and on cue, I looked down.</p>

<p>They. Were. Not. F&rsquo;ing, There.</p>

<p>My brain went into a whirlwind as i looked down at my bare feet wondering painfully where I kept my new Nike slippers and I started looking around my seat frantically. The gates were closing at the station, ready for departure. As I looked out the window, silently cursing under my breath, looking at the slow moving platform, I saw the little girl, the girl I offered the seat to a while back, smiling at me, holding the feet shaped form of my black and neon green slippers, waving with her other hand.</p>

<p>Damn, so that&rsquo;s where they went, I exclaimed, wondering about other idle souls scanning through people&rsquo;s feet and I mused about their conjectures of a man in kurta and no footwear,</p>

<p>A simple lunatic, a phony philosopher or just a man who lost his shoes?</p>
