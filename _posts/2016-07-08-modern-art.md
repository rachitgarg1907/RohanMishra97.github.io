<h2>Why Post-Modern Art is not shit.</h2>
(<i>Commentary, 3 minute read</i>)
<p>The title of this article is something controversial. I mean, have you seen modern art?! They just put up anything anywhere and ‘oh, my god. Such a genius. The depiction of oppression in the society is palpable in this masterpiece’.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me? You felt the oppression from a broken bottle kept on an overturned table?</p>
<p>Seems ridiculous, doesn’t it? Have you seen Marcel Duchamp’s seminal modern art masterpiece? No? Well, I’m telling you that you have. In 1917, Marcel Duchamp took a porcelain urinal, rotated it 90 degrees, and put it on the ground. That broke the art community. Duchamp said that his intent was to shift the focus of art from physical craft to intellectual interpretation.</p>
<p>Before aimlessly going ahead, let’s take a step back and ask “What is art?”</p>
<p>That’s a good question. What is art? Art is not continuous. It flows through times, conforming to adjust with the mentalities and the culture of the ages. To Plato, art was imitation of nature. Then photographers came and took over that job. In the 20th century, artists like Picasso and Monet came around and they shifted the definition of art from the imitation to the ‘feel’ of nature. Since then, art has been majorly associated with the ‘feel’ of the world we live in.</p>
<p>The definition of modern art follows from this. It’s just the feel of the world we live in. The amazingly chaotic, hectic, broken and hard-to-figure-out-messes which art galleries go nuts to display? They’re a reflection of our world. Our crazy world, full of all these modern baits, these metal monsters running on the ground, the metal birds flying in the sky.</p>
<p>Take Scream. Edvard Munch’s Scream is not your usual beautiful masterpiece. It makes you uncomfortable. It ‘expresses’ the image. It ‘reflects’ the plight of the modern age man. But you know what? That’s your own ‘interpretation’.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still call modern art rubbish. Duchamp’s piece is literally something you piss on. You can say, “Hey! That’s arbitrary! Even I could have done that!” But you didn’t. He did it before you. However simplistic and arbitrary modern art may be, it’s there. The most powerful museums and galleries of the world house it with a religious fervour. It sells for millions. You can call it bullshit. The museums and artists won’t bat an eye. You know why? Because as long as someone dismisses, it is still provocative. Contemporary art has established itself as subversive, radical and challenging. And it must be so. The people are still calling it bullshit.</p>
