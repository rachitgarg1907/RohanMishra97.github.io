<h2>Feel</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>A strong case of feels they say,<br>
Not at such a crucial time, I pray.<br>
Thumping in the chest,<br>
Pressure rising in veins<br>
With every trough and crest<br>
The heart starts to break the chains.</p>

<p>Feel, my precious,<br>
We weren’t meant to hold back.<br>
Don’t pull the reins; be curious<br>
Let yourself soar high.<br>
Love. Cry. Fall. Or break.<br>
Just don’t regret it at the end.</p>

<p>Life is a journey,<br>
Finished by all but enjoyed by the brave.</p>
