<h3>Sky is the limit</h3>
(<i>poetry,1 minute read</i>)
<p>Life is nothing, but loads of limits,<br>
Speed limit on Roads, word limit on Boards,<br>
Distance limit in Relations and tummy limit for Foods.</p>
 
<p>Blessed are those, who excel within limits.<br>
Doomed are the Devils, who selfishly break limits.</p>
 
<p>Survival of the Fittest- a proverb that enlightens me.<br>
Care for the poor my Mother tells me,</p>
 
<p>If I aim to get, Dream is the limit,<br>
If I aim to give, Sky is the limit</p>
 
<p>I, Me and Myself and all the modern world blows<br>
You, We and all of Us, I would propose<br>
Cry and You cry alone.<br>
Laugh and the World laughs with you</p>
 
<p>Don’t count the number of laughs you had in a day,<br>
Tot up the tears, you wiped from the sad face</p>
 
<p>Sky is the limit for Brutality<br>
Sky is also the limit for Humanity</p>
 
<p>Tensions, Difficulties, Temptations, Struggles and Confrontations<br>
If you look at the dark side, life is all about Struggles<br>
Every person has a Mountain to climb<br>
But, take one step at a time, the  journey will be sublime</p>
 
<p>In today’s world, there is absolutely no limit,<br>
For competition, contests-you certainly have to win it!<br>
There are quite a few, who have raced ahead of others,<br>
But it’s only a matter of time, then no one will bother.</p>
 
<p>There is no limit for anything, it’s a race against time,<br>
You have to keep holding on to every single dime,<br>
Sky is the limit- a quote well-known,<br>
And through the world’s competition, it is clearly shown.</p>

<p>-Raunak Kapur</p>
