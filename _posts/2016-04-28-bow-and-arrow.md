<h2>Bow vs. Arrow</h2>
(<i>Commentary, 5 minute read</i>)
<p>Being an atheist, I have always felt that atheism is the best thing that can happen to an Indian, especially an Indian with a zeal for literature. Our forefathers have given us a plethora of bewildering stories whose true essence can only be understood by someone who thinks rationally and not “ideally”. Reading and listening to the unadulterated versions of Indian mythological stories is something I cherish.</p>
<p>The two most prominent or dynamic characters in the mythology or rather “Indian history” (as my grandmother loves to state) are Ram and Krishna. These two “Gods” are utterly loved and worshiped in every Hindu household. But for me, they are merely the male leads of two patriarchal yet perplexing stories. And hence, they have been a matter of constant contemplation for a long time.</p>
<p>There have been numerous debates regarding which of the two was a greater hero. Ram has always been portrayed as the “ideal man” or “maryada purushottam”. He is shown to be the ideal son, ideal ruler and a loyal husband. But at the same time, he is blamed for abandoning his pregnant wife at a time when she needed him the most. Krishna on the other hand has been portrayed as a Casanova (not to offend anyone) who had thousands of wives but never married the lady he loved the most, Radha.</p>
<p>When it comes to rules and righteousness, it has been said that Ram placed rules above everything in his life. Abandoning Sita was not “right” but was “ideal” in the big book of morals. He did not marry again, but that cannot be considered as enough justice to Sita’s wounds.Ram could have fought his ideals, done the right thing and been the good husband to his wife, but his moral compass did not let him astray from the path of ideality.. Whereas, Krishna manipulated laws in order to protect the dharma or righteousness. Krishna did not mind lying to do the rightful. Ram is the “ideal man” and Krishna is the “ideal strategist”.</p>
<p>I believe, Ram was born in a yuga that was too good to be true. Surrounded by a crowd of idealistic people (wife who would follow him even to hell, brother who would not accept kingship, father who would die but not break his word, etc), Ram was pressurized by the legacy of ideal ancestors. I see him as someone being forced to be one in the continuum.</p> 
<p>Whereas, Krishna is born in those times where for generations, every father has screwed up his son's life (Shantanu caused Bhishma to take up celibacy, Bhishma caused Ambika and Ambalika to undergo Niyoga, Dhritarasthra gives a free run to his son's immaturities, Pandu wanted sons with super capabilities and yet does not raise a finger to secure their future.) The whole setup was screaming for a revamp. Krishna chose to challenge this understanding of good and bad, he chose to take the situation into his hands and dictate it purely because he could not find any sense in compliance.</p>
<p>Ram is the idealization of a human being whereas Krishna is the realization of a human being. Being a naughty child, mischievous teenager, passionate lover, valiant warrior, powerful savior, shrewd statesman, dear friend, wise guide, virtuous teacher and an extremely manipulating strategist, Krishna is shown as a whole spectrum of qualities a man must possess in order to become a legend that is chanted through the ages.</p>
<p>The difference between Krishna and Ram is that between reality and ideality. Ram tells us what to do whereas Krishna tells us how to do it. </p>
