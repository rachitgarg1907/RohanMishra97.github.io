<h3>Touch</h3>
(<i>Poetry,1 minute read</i>)
<p>I am on the other side&nbsp;<br />
enslaved by the door&mdash; Distance.<br />
I am<br />
blinded by the sight,<br />
deafened by the voice,<br />
dumb by the patient ears<br />
of you.<br />
I can only feel your touch (in advance)<br />
as a bird feels a shadow.</p>
