<h2>Mother's Love</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>A warm chill spreads through,tender,protective,giving way to marvel. My itsy-bitsy fingers in the mitt,she entwined for me this frost. Oh! I miss the rays in her womb,milk showers and ice cream bath,when she was moody. Her love is at zenith, her eyes gaze at mine and we connect through the cosmos, as i kicked out of her.Our soma separated,but souls still the same thread. She planted a kiss on my forehead, a chill again, as our eyes dance in twilight,while i reciprocated the rays of her womb,so intense. Benovelence bubbled up from the tears and trickled my cheeks,still blushing of her love. Her hands stroking my thin hair, releasing toxins of affection into my encephalon. And calms my hunger with her milk showers again,with not the calf's share, but with her bosom, yellow followed by fair. Can't echo if I asked for a guide to planet, He planted one . Leave us alone,this one-off is to be left in a cave. Keys? Only gushing cascades of compassion can unlock it.</p>
