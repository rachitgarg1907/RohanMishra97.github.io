<h2>The Parting Gift</h2>
(<i>Life, 3 minute read</i>)
<p>An irritating day at work, a week of severe migraine, and a month of running to and fro the bank later I woke up to a click of the door unlocking.</p>
<p>Standing in front of me, drenched from head to toe was our beautiful but scared kid of 18. I think of all the ways she could fall sick, however, I reach out for my watch first.</p>
<p>10:54pm.</p>
<p>I look back up at her, as if waiting for an answer to a question I didn’t even ask. She trembles, from the cold and the fright of being grounded, but does not says a word. I warm her a glass of hot chocolate and go back to my room.</p>
<p>“Mom?”, she calls out.</p>
<p>“Yes, beta?</p>
<p>“Mom, I’m sorry, they.. I didn’t.. they just didn’t get out of the party in time.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, drink your hot chocolate and dry yourself off properly. I don’t want another headache of you getting sick.”</p>
<p>“Mom?”</p>
<p>I turn back.</p>
<p>“Can I sleep next to you tonight?”</p>
<p>I smile.</p>

<hr>
<p>“How are you going to do it, Neha? How do you think will you raise this child? And what are you going to answer to everyone who asks about it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I will do it, I know. Because I want to. And for everyone, I will tell them the truth. That I bore Avi a child before we got married.”
My mother looks at me, stunned. Definitely not expecting the reply, she opens her mouth to speak, but refrains.
Over the next couple of months, I never left Avi’s side and somewhere in between all the chaos, I found reason with Avi and our child.My mother, however, never failed to point out, “You both could still get married, you know?”</p>
<p>But we didn’t want to. Sure, we could have gotten married, and have the society give our child a legitimate name. But we did not. It would still be our child.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many evenings, while snuggling up to each other, Avi loved to discuss our future. Our jobs, our bikes, our trips, our house, our wedding, whether we wanted kids.
In one of these dim lighted evening, looking over the city skyline, I had commented, “What if we never get to fulfil these plans?”
He had looked over at me, pained, “And why do you think that will ever be possible?”</p>
<p>“No, what if?”</p>
<p>He took my face in his hands, “I promise you, it will. And when it does, I shall give you the biggest ring you’d have ever seen in your life.”
“You know what I mean. I don’t want that ring from you, I want us to be able to buy that house we saw by the beach for ourselves. I want to be able to buy you the bike you have a picture of on your cupboard. I want us to see the world before we settle down, Avi. Do we have the time?” , he looked on at the skyline, I looked on at his perfect, sombre face. It hurt to think if I had hurt him.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity of contemplation, he looked at me, “I am ready to wait. And I could wait till you have achieved all that you want to, but I will make sure I give you that ring.”, he winked.
I smiled, and kissed the man of my dreams.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year to that evening, Avi was diagnosed with leukemia.</p>
