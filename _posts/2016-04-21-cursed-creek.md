<h2>Cursed Creek</h2>
(<i>Poetry</i>)
<p>Aeons before in a land of strange wonders,
lived a Nymph in jinxed blockade.
The land was cursed: no birds no bees;
but rocks and rocks as far as one can see.
Blue and morose
would the forlorn Maid sit,
for her hapless solitude: a grievance too big.
Perched atop a rock one day,
sat the lonesome Maid;
hours passed, the Maiden wept,
fell into slumber.
A strange dream she had:
rocks made into lawns,
creatures winged and with feathers
played amid the boughs.
The maiden opened her eyes next day
to find a land so green.
The sun shone gently above,
no more did it scorch the her fair skin.
Right beside the maiden, stood a smiling tree,
“I am the wise willow.” greeted he.
A curtsy for the tree, gratitude for the heavens,
for finally the kind Gods had heard her plea.
Elated in bliss, the days went by,
until one night in the darkest hour
when a strange storm raised on.
The Nymph awoke in the morning
to see a creek carved into the stones.
It sang of love and life, and of places unknown.
Awed , she gave her heart away
to a singing creek that flowed.
A huge leap of faith.
Little did she know
of what was about to come,
Her love without a thought
was about to take a sharp turn.
The poor Nymph gave away
all she had for her love.
Her heart and soul not hers any more,
the creek their ruler now.
What had seemed before
beaming with mirth and life
became a bane with no end
for it moved and moved
past rocks and cliffs,
that scratched her heart and made it bleed.
Begged with tears, the Nymph
for the creek to pause and take a breath.
Sadly denied, the creek
for it knew not how to breathe.
All it could do was move ahead,
the world moved too fast for him.
Time and tide never do wait,
and neither could he.
Alone and doomed once again,
sobbed the Nymph under the Willow.
Sans heart and sans soul now,
for what shall she live?
Stood before the creek, the Nymph;
with a pain so terrible she cursed:
Her poor soul would not be lost alone,
for those who shall give their hearts in fervent ardour,
shall loose their soul forever.
Saying this she gave her life
to the same creek she once loved.
The land became barren once again,
the Nymph’s curse then started
taking it’s toll.
The creek flows till today
drowning souls of those in love.
A few can dare retrieve
their hearts so in love,
but only when their worlds pause.
Call it truth, call it myth,
but what has been done can not come undone.
And if ye’ not believe it,
ask the lovers who have loved!</p>
