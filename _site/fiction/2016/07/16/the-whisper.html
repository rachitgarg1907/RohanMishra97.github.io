          <h3>The Whisper</h3>
<p>(<i>Fiction,2 minute read</i>)</p>
<p>The man was acutely aware of the sweat beads forming on his temples. He was pretty sure his shirt was wet. A quick sniff of his armpits confirmed his suspicions. The man took a deep breath and grabbed the doorknob. The steel knob was starkly cold to touch. The air conditioner kept the entire office to a comfortable 22 degrees, but it was not like his sweat glands gave a damn. He turned it. The brown door swung in without a sound. It was a&nbsp;very ordinary brown door, but there was pair of gray bolts that held up the cheap metal plaque upon the ordinary brown door. The metal plaque read Manager. The cheap metal plaque turned the ordinary brown door into something extraordinary. The Manager was sitting comfortably in her large ergonomic leather chair. She was tapping her finger on the desk while staring at the laptop screen. Ma&rsquo;am? She looked at him and gestured him to sit. The man closed the door behind him.<br />
The extraordinary brown door opened soundlessly. The man&rsquo;s shirt was absolutely drenched. The walk back to his office seemed to stretch on forever. His office welcomed him with the ordinary brown door. The ordinary brown door opened noiselessly and closed with a slam. He sat at his desk and looked out of the window. The window was not particularly large and the view wasn&rsquo;t much, just some apartment buildings and a quiet street, but he loved it. The man scouted his favourite houses for activity. He liked to look at people&rsquo;s lives from afar, the vicarious spectator. Even the most mundane of jobs seemed most amusing.<br />
Suddenly, his eyes froze. The man&rsquo;s head froze and he felt the beads of sweat roll down from his temples to his cheeks. He was fixated on the house on the fifth floor.<br />
The girl was standing on the balcony railing. She was looking down, probably gauging how far down it was. The man stared at her brainlessly, mesmerised, afraid. His trembling hands raised the telephone. He had to dial the emergency. The other hand searched for the keypad while the eyes remained fixated on the girl. He couldn&rsquo;t see her emotions from this far off. Was she crying? The man looked harder, stunned, mesmerised. The man felt empty. The man felt inhuman. The man felt.. What did he feel. The man wondered. The fingers wandered around the keypad, not shaking anymore, the phone no longer raised.<br />
The girl jumped.<br />
His eyes didn&rsquo;t leave her.<br />
The man gathered his things, put them in a box and looked out of the window for the last time.<br />
The ordinary brown door opened noiselessly and closed like a whisper.&nbsp;<br />
