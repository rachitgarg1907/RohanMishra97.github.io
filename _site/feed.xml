        <title>The Phoenix in You</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;The Phoenix in You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,1 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I am hanging by a thread.&lt;br /&gt;
I can travel up but the heat will scorch me or I can fall down into the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;
But here in the middle it feels good. There is still hope. No extremities. You would think its good.&lt;br /&gt;
But no , it&amp;#39;s even worse. It&amp;#39;s the sweet poison which slowly erodes all your senses and then all you will ever be able to do is just hang there.&lt;br /&gt;
But you can make a bold and brave choice.&lt;br /&gt;
You can fall down below or you can travel up.&lt;br /&gt;
It will surely break you.&lt;br /&gt;
But from those pieces, you can build a new you.&lt;br /&gt;
It will be difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
But it&amp;#39;s a welcome change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Happiness is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,1 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright, pink.&lt;br /&gt;
Fluffy, moist and lovely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filled with air ,&lt;br /&gt;
within and without.&lt;br /&gt;
A fleeting sweet taste,&lt;br /&gt;
a scarlet tongue&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And sticky gums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cotton candy for two,&lt;br /&gt;
Or one, the memory of two.&lt;br /&gt;
A beach walk in July,&lt;br /&gt;
Drenched clothes&lt;br /&gt;
And Sticky hair.&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>A Terribly Uninteresting Tale</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;A Terribly Uninteresting Tale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Fiction,3 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People. People everywhere. Look to the right, left, ahead, backwards, upwards, everywhere just people. It&amp;rsquo;s terribly annoying to be around people sometimes. If there are so many people, the voices get jumbled up and all you hear is a not so gentle hiss and hum of different voices, juxtaposed together. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to eavesdrop conversations when you cannot hear comprehensible phrases. Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;
So, I sit on a bench, near an intersection. It&amp;rsquo;s around 6 o&amp;#39; clock in the evening, and there are literally a hundred people around me. There&amp;rsquo;s a friend with me, and he too is talking, but I can&amp;rsquo;t hear him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m searching for someone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;ll be here, I think to myself. I have to do this today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating about talking to this one girl for the past few days. Okay, I admit, a year, to be exact. Every time I see her, hell, every time I see any new girl that I like, I freeze and am unable to talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve researched about it, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a disease. The internet tells me it&amp;rsquo;s a mental construct of some sort, but you can&amp;rsquo;t believe everything that&amp;rsquo;s on the internet, can you now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at my wrist watch. The smaller dial is on 6 and the larger one is somewhere between 5 and 10. Feeling agitated, I start stomping my foot on the ground continually, much to the annoyance of the girl standing next to me. I look up to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I notice she has black hair tied up like a bun, she&amp;rsquo;s wearing this unusually dark pinkish coloured tee, a strand of her hair falling right in front of her left eye. Her face is beautifully constructed, I observe but the expression she has is really not that pleasing. She&amp;rsquo;s talking to someone on her phone and looking at me at the same time, the same look I get from my mother when I do something stupid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I look down and stop stomping my foot. Then I contemplate about all the stupid things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A snap of my friend&amp;rsquo;s fingers brings back my consciousness. I look up to see him looking at me, inquisitively. His unusually wrinkly eyes pry on mine, almost invading my personal space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; I ask.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We have to go, it&amp;rsquo;s getting late.&amp;rdquo; he replies.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes yes, wait, she&amp;rsquo;ll be here, then we&amp;rsquo;ll go&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damn it, I can&amp;rsquo;t stay here. Looking at so many pretty girl depresses me&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then go talk to one&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Like you can&amp;rdquo; he says, rolling his eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I will, today. Just let her come&amp;rdquo; I say, my eyes, probably, are beaming.&lt;br /&gt;
He stands up and walks towards a shady looking corner. I don&amp;rsquo;t notice where he goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Now my eyes search for her. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m patient right now, hell I&amp;rsquo;m panicking like something. A deer, or zebra, waiting for a lion to pounce on it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, the whole space that my eyes can look at turns red. Completely. I can&amp;rsquo;t see because it&amp;rsquo;s out of focus. On shutting them tight and opening them, I notice a red bus has invaded my vision. I see that it goes to my locality. I look to where my friend stood a minute before to see he&amp;rsquo;s walking towards the bus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey, wait, she might come!&amp;rdquo; I say&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Man, I&amp;rsquo;m tired. I&amp;rsquo;m going&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wait up&amp;rdquo; I say, but not before I inspect my surroundings, one last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I see her, with three of her friends, walking merrily, she&amp;rsquo;s wearing this light-ish blue tee that just makes her stand out from the bland colours around her. Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t even notice her friends.&lt;br /&gt;
But then my mind decides to plot against me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know who you are, stop thinking and get on the bus&amp;rdquo;, it says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I never think logically when it comes love, but right now, I feel my brain is right. I have no right to be around her, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t care. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I step on the bus, hanging right by the edge, looking on as she walks away from me. I contemplate getting off, but just at that moment, the bus starts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I sigh and fully get inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll talk to her tomorrow&amp;rdquo;, my mind consoles me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
I wish I would, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lost</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,1 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the laps of the calm waves engulfing the rapids, inundating my feet.&lt;br /&gt;
In the labyrinth of clouds enveloping the winds, silencing my shambolic head.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In the morass of trees in an embrace so tight, impeding the glimpses the sky steals at me.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I&amp;#39;m lost,&lt;br /&gt;
In a lust so deep it consumes my existence for a thirst to wander.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Night in the Train</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;A Night in the Train&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Romance,3 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up with a start. It was dark, but the person standing in front of me was someone who I&amp;rsquo;d probably never forget.&lt;br /&gt;
It had been a long time since we last talked, I thought. Yet, here she was, standing in front of me. I sat up and shifted on my berth, to make space for her. I&amp;rsquo;d always loved train journeys, but the thought of sharing it with someone who meant so much to me brought a smile to my face. I had never expected this to happen on this college trip in my wildest dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to hide it but she probably caught me in the act. She sat in front of me, looking to make a conversation. My gaze was fixed on her face. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it pretty, but yes, she was beautiful. With her round, deep-brown chocolate eyes and a triangular face, she looked mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;
I said, &amp;rdquo;After all that happened, here you are.&amp;rdquo; I believed that the spark, the chemistry was lost between us, I was wrong. She stared right into my eyes and then looked outside the window. Searching for answers in the unknown. She asked, &amp;rdquo;Do you still love me the same way you used to?&amp;rdquo; I replied back with a nod.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a time when I was the one asking all the questions. Why me? But I thought you loved me? Why did you play with my emotions? Such questions clouded my mind at all times. It was her turn to ask questions. Looking me straight in the eyes, she asked, &amp;rdquo;What happened to us, Rahul? There was a time when we used to talk all day long.&amp;rdquo; She continued, &amp;rdquo;It was all so good. You enjoyed my company and I enjoyed yours. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a topic left which we hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked about. We quenched each other&amp;rsquo;s thirst of a good conversation. A genuine company. Someone who would care for all the stuff other people didn&amp;rsquo;t care about. Someone who would care about me just as much as I cared about him.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Why did you have to fuck up?&amp;rdquo; She asked. Those words sank in like a blade to my heart. Only I knew how much I missed her. Those late-night conversations, those playful rebuttals. All I wanted her to know was that I still cared.&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I was hearing this question. My past had been an unfortunate eyewitness of all my screw-ups. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know when to give in. When to close my mouth to save a relationship. It had cost me dearly. In my own self-righteous way, I always thought I was doing the right thing. What I missed was, I was probably just hurting the other person.&lt;br /&gt;
While all of this was going on in my head, I spoke nothing. Because the truth is, I had no proper explanation for why I did what I did. That&amp;rsquo;s what I always did. I fucked up. What remained was my love, I still adored her. Not one day, one moment passes by that I didn&amp;rsquo;t hope or want for her to be by my side. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore. My face was a clear reflection of my thoughts, the wrinkles on my forehead were waves formed by the storm raging inside my head. What I wanted to say, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. What I wanted her to know, she could read on my face. She looked into my eyes and it felt as if she could stare deep down into my soul. All my fears, insecurities, lies and secrets, she now knew.&lt;br /&gt;
I finally mustered up the courage to say something. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry&amp;rdquo;, is all I said. But a voice came from within and I continued, &amp;rdquo;I am sorry for being such a jerk. Sorry for hurting you, demeaning you and not being there for you. I know I&amp;rsquo;m a piece of work but that&amp;rsquo;s just who I am. I never meant for this to happen. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to say a lot more. But you already know how I feel about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, just shifted a bit and sat beside me. I could see her face clearly now. I could feel her warmth. It was the best feeling in the world, to be near her. I felt protected. I kept my hand on hers, almost instinctively. She didn&amp;rsquo;t oppose and I let it rest. I looked at her, trying to make out what was going on inside her head. But her face was expressionless, eyes staring in another direction. She was lost in deep thought. &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo;, I said, almost in a whisper but loud enough for her to hear. She finally looked me in the eyes and said ,&amp;rdquo;I love you too.&amp;rdquo; I wanted to cry, to laugh, to scream and to be silent at the same time. But most of all, I just wanted to embrace this moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Lie besides me&amp;rdquo;, I said. She obliged. Moonlight was flowing in from the windows now, illuminating her face. It was just inches away from mine. Although none of us spoke anything, our eyes could hardly keep quiet. They were my weakness. Her round, brown eyes staring into mine. I could have hoped for that moment to last forever but my mind was busy thinking about her. After a long time, i felt at ease. She was my comfort zone. It was our zone now. I kept my hand on her waist and pulled her closer. My actions took her by surprise, but she seemed happy. A small smile now creeped up her previously expressionless face. &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t ever push you for a relationship&amp;rdquo;, I said. &amp;ldquo;But now, I want one&amp;rdquo;, was her reply.&lt;br /&gt;
I was still for a moment, weighing the words which had just come out of her mouth. I was instantly thinking about the consequences, letting the truth to sink in. I stared right into her eyes and then at her lips. Her perfectly shaped, full lips. She got the message. My lips went straight for hers. All the passion just came pouring out. The world came to a halt; that moment was my singularity. I could taste her on the tip of my tongue. All that she wanted to say, all that was left unsaid, all her insecurities, I could read.&lt;br /&gt;
I put my arms around her waist and pulled her in my warm embrace. I could feel her heart beating just inches away from mine. We broke the kiss and stared hard into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Thinking about the ramifications of our actions. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore. My hands slowly brushed her cheeks and pulled her in for another kiss. Her hands went straight for my hair, it was even more passionate now, almost animalistic. Our tongues entwined as if they were dancing to a ballad. Our heartbeats now formed an almost harmonious rhythm. It was then that I realised that people search for salvation all their lives and that I had found mine.&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>When The Fuckboy Falls in Love</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;When The Fuckboy Falls in Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Fiction,3 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As she bit my lip, I let out a small hiss through my teeth. Should I, should I not? I gripped her tighter. I think I should. So I made my hands go further down the slight curve of her body trying to stop where I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;
And I was stupefied by an unsettling realisation. I went with the shouldn&amp;#39;t. I didn&amp;#39;t put my hands over the swell of her chest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Just a little squeeze of her tiny waist and I mentally laughed for me, Nakul Sachdev, a guy who never thought twice before starting a hot make out with my hands all over the girl&amp;#39;s assets, was now rejoicing in the little curves of this girl&amp;#39;s waist. She had ignited in me a lust, a lust so new it dripped with a longing of her presence and presence only. No hanky-panky, no dirty businesses. Just her, sitting, singing in her husky voice, or merely laugh at the silliest of my jokes with her slight body cosied up in the car seat beside me. I don&amp;#39;t even mind her feet being up, the black thread anklet being the centre of my attention ignoring all the childhood scars she was so afraid to show.&lt;br /&gt;
Her innocence would have an effect so profound on me, I never knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being her first kiss is glorious enough, I won&amp;#39;t let myself go down the same old routine I share with the girls I&amp;#39;ve had. Not with this one. She is a woman&lt;br /&gt;
A true woman. And I&amp;#39;ll wait for her. (Her begging me is also a fantasy though).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone of you is knowledgeable enough to understand this new terminology seeing it has taken the social media like a storm. Fuckboy. For those of you not that fortunate, it means a male who acts, lies, cheats, enacts, pretends to be someone else, has multiple identities and alibis, all in the aim of getting into a girl&amp;#39;s pants.&lt;br /&gt;
Nowadays, the increase in number of short term relationships or as we call them, friends with benefits; the new wave of online dating; polygamy when the other person doesn&amp;#39;t know about it (for laymen, cheating) have conditioned the heads of girls to a level that even a guy asking the directions to a place with a smile on his face will be tagged as a fuckboy for any lady. Maybe he is that, maybe he loves this life and the sense of freedom it provides him. And obviously, it&amp;#39;s a small world and the reputations of this category of men follows them everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
The real complication occurs when this gentleman actually falls in love. The reputation won&amp;#39;t help you now, will it? And a girl, no matter how naive she is and how this guy is a dream for her and how she is head over heels for this guy, won&amp;#39;t give in, won&amp;#39;t ever trust him when he confesses his feelings for you. It might be another act to aid him to get into her pants. So what do we do now?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is simple. Do what you never did boy, befriend her. The idea of taking someone out for a coffee or pancakes is so bizarre for us that the amazing outcomes of these 3 hours you spend without looking at your phones have obliterated from our minds. Loving someone means loving the person in front of you, not the girls he did it with, not the people he met, not the number of swipes he got on Tinder. It is just a leap of faith girls, you need to overcome your fears. Also, there is always an option of going diabolical and setting his house on fire if he does what you feared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will stick to this, you will not find the better half unless you have at least three failed relationships. And what if he was a fuckboy indeed. You made him stop, you made him leave the lifestyle he adopted for years, you made him concentrate on one centre of his universe, and that&amp;#39;s you, take pride in that, keep your head high and go for it. It is okay to let go. In this bedlam of a universe, it is only you who can protect yourself and only you who will harm yourself. Hence, what will be your golden word? Happiness or Conjecture? I leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Whisper</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;The Whisper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Fiction,2 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was acutely aware of the sweat beads forming on his temples. He was pretty sure his shirt was wet. A quick sniff of his armpits confirmed his suspicions. The man took a deep breath and grabbed the doorknob. The steel knob was starkly cold to touch. The air conditioner kept the entire office to a comfortable 22 degrees, but it was not like his sweat glands gave a damn. He turned it. The brown door swung in without a sound. It was a&amp;nbsp;very ordinary brown door, but there was pair of gray bolts that held up the cheap metal plaque upon the ordinary brown door. The metal plaque read Manager. The cheap metal plaque turned the ordinary brown door into something extraordinary. The Manager was sitting comfortably in her large ergonomic leather chair. She was tapping her finger on the desk while staring at the laptop screen. Ma&amp;rsquo;am? She looked at him and gestured him to sit. The man closed the door behind him.&lt;br /&gt;
The extraordinary brown door opened soundlessly. The man&amp;rsquo;s shirt was absolutely drenched. The walk back to his office seemed to stretch on forever. His office welcomed him with the ordinary brown door. The ordinary brown door opened noiselessly and closed with a slam. He sat at his desk and looked out of the window. The window was not particularly large and the view wasn&amp;rsquo;t much, just some apartment buildings and a quiet street, but he loved it. The man scouted his favourite houses for activity. He liked to look at people&amp;rsquo;s lives from afar, the vicarious spectator. Even the most mundane of jobs seemed most amusing.&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, his eyes froze. The man&amp;rsquo;s head froze and he felt the beads of sweat roll down from his temples to his cheeks. He was fixated on the house on the fifth floor.&lt;br /&gt;
The girl was standing on the balcony railing. She was looking down, probably gauging how far down it was. The man stared at her brainlessly, mesmerised, afraid. His trembling hands raised the telephone. He had to dial the emergency. The other hand searched for the keypad while the eyes remained fixated on the girl. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t see her emotions from this far off. Was she crying? The man looked harder, stunned, mesmerised. The man felt empty. The man felt inhuman. The man felt.. What did he feel. The man wondered. The fingers wandered around the keypad, not shaking anymore, the phone no longer raised.&lt;br /&gt;
The girl jumped.&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes didn&amp;rsquo;t leave her.&lt;br /&gt;
The man gathered his things, put them in a box and looked out of the window for the last time.&lt;br /&gt;
The ordinary brown door opened noiselessly and closed like a whisper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Deja Vu</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Deja Vu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,1 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let my thoughts&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
catch an aeroplane in the wind:&lt;br /&gt;
I imagine our love&lt;br /&gt;
to be like&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
honey&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
never stale and bad;&lt;br /&gt;
Or moon&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
that constantly disappears only to shine again;&lt;br /&gt;
Or d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
fresh everytime it occurs yet usual as it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Touch</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Touch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,1 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on the other side&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
enslaved by the door&amp;mdash; Distance.&lt;br /&gt;
I am&lt;br /&gt;
blinded by the sight,&lt;br /&gt;
deafened by the voice,&lt;br /&gt;
dumb by the patient ears&lt;br /&gt;
of you.&lt;br /&gt;
I can only feel your touch (in advance)&lt;br /&gt;
as a bird feels a shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fear</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Poetry,2 minute read&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he has conquered all,&lt;br /&gt;
Seldom has he tasted defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All who have bowed down&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
To his triumph,&lt;br /&gt;
Have lost all,&lt;br /&gt;
Pride, love, life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For he conquers every being,&lt;br /&gt;
Be it men in the battle,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The innocent held hostage,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Or the girl standing outside&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Her examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He plays around with her,&lt;br /&gt;
When she walks in the dark,&lt;br /&gt;
He smiles at her,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When she looks for acceptance&lt;br /&gt;
In the eyes of her peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He strangles her when alone,&lt;br /&gt;
While footsteps follow her,&lt;br /&gt;
When the family she loved,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Sets her on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once he looks into her eyes,&lt;br /&gt;
And can&amp;#39;t see himself amidst.&lt;br /&gt;
The moment she declares,&lt;br /&gt;
She shall have the last laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
