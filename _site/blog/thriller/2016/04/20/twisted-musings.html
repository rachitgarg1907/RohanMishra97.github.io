          <h2>Twisted Musings</h2>
<p>(<i>Thriller, 4 minute read</i>)</p>
<p>Ever wondered what it’d feel like to slice someone open? To strap them down on a table, gurney, bed, anywhere, have them writhing around helplessly, while they watch you play around with your instruments of artー butchers’ knives, hacksaws, chainsaws, drills. Those shiny pieces of metal gleaming in the dingy ‘kill room’.
You stop to think whether you should sedate your newest victim, but you like, no, love it, when they scream out in terror before you’ve even started to actually play your sick little game一 that of torturing them to the point where they beg you, incessantly, to just finish them off. That’s when you get your prizeー to see the light go out of their eyes while you deliver your final blow, and the silent thank you that it communicates, gratitude just because of the ‘mercy’ you bestowed upon them, freeing them from the pain. The beast within is satiated,albeit temporarily.</p>
<p>Dipping your hands in that velvety red pool, and then watching it trickle down the remainder of your arms, makes you feel all the more powerful. You justify your actions thinking that god kills too. He lures people into the real world by showing promises of a happier tomorrow, only to end in sadness, loneliness and regret. At the thought of loneliness, the beast stirs again, restlessly. Your lust for more skin and bones grow, and you abandon your piece of art, clean yourself up, and start scouring the streets for a new ‘play-date’.</p>
<p>Heading out into the waning sunlight, you watch the night life bloom, and you stop the admire the sight. A girl catches your fancy. Her seemingly golden skin makes your mouth water, and you can’t wait carve on it with your favourite knife. But what really makes her attractive is the look of utmost desolation on her face. “Well”, you think, “she’ll be an easy catch.” Feeling a bit disappointed at the apparent lack of a proper, engaging cat-and-mouse game, you start to follow her discreetly. She senses you, and speeds up. She tries to put in as much distance as she can, but fails. Taking a sharp turn, she tries disappearing into a dingy alley, and you mentally exclaim “Checkmate!”.</p>
<p>Entering the alley yourself, your eyes hungrily search for her, and that’s when you feel a sharp blow to your head. The next thing you know, you’re strapped to your own table, your previous ‘art-piece’ lying next to you. The girl’s face swims in your vision, and you hear her story about how she loves every murder you ever committed, your art, and that she tried to bring the same level of greatness in her ‘work'. But she still felt incomplete, and realised that to bring a sense of achievement, she’d have to kill her ‘master’. Promising to use the most creative methods, his very own methods on him, she brings in his tools and starts her own twisted game.</p>
<p>You never thought you would get unnaturally high from the smell of your own blood. It smells even more delicious when it mingles with that of your last prey, and the sound of your skin being sliced open is all the more melodious. The sadist in you turns into a masochist, as you strive to stay conscious and instruct her on how to make clean cuts using a bone saw.</p>
<p>You couldn’t have gone down in a more fashionable way.</p>
