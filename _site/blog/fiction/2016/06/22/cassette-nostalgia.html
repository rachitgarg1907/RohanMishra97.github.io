<p><em>(Music, 2 minute read)</em></p>
<p>There are days when you stay at home, doing nothing and suddenly your mother comes up and tortures you to get up from the couch and do some chores. So, one fine sunny morning I was forced by her to go and clean the attic.Being super lazy, I tried to do as little as possible and leave the room. Then something caught my attention.</p>
<p>A box titled “Cassettes”.</p>
<p>Going through it I saw the collection of songs my brother had collected when he was a teenager. This brought forth a whirlpool of memories and the nostalgia was overpowering. So, I perched the cassette player on the desk and popped in a cassette. The songs were old and perhaps I’d even forgotten most of their lyrics, but there was some faint memory linked with the songs. It made me reminiscence the long drives we used to go with dad on our little and cozy Maruti and how we used to sing the songs along and aloud.</p>
<p>There is an iconic gesture that is related with the era of cassettes, when I used to stick a pencil in that coloured plastic case and rewiring a tape gone askewed. I also recall the intensity and focus with which my brother pressed the RECORD and PLAY button at the same time when he was making mixtapes!</p>
<p>Listening to a tape is a different experience altogether. You can’t switch tracks as you wish, the glorious melody of a reel back or a fast forward, and the iconic low fidelity makes up for a unique and charismatic memory. There is a something unique and intangible about listening to a cassette tape with the songs from 90s. There is perhaps some form of romanticism associated with it, something that iPods and MP3 players can only hope to replicate, but in vain.</p>
<p>My nostalgia and longing for the sounds and the mild distortions from the tape are really significant probably because this is a medium that stays intact. Probably, because I like feeling and touching the music. I can’t comprehend and completely experience the zeros and ones in the myriad of MP3 files on my phone. The artist’s nuances are lost in translation to me in the frequencies and algorithms of digitally mastering the songs.</p>
<p>Listening to cassette tapes sure was a trip down the memory lane for me. So if you are just another nostalgic kid of the 90s, I urge you to find a tape, sit down and listen to it. Trust me, it is worth it. </p>
