<p>(<i> Music, 3 minutes </i>) <br /></p>
<p>It was the year of 1979. My dad, a teenager then, heard something that changed his life. From the transistor radio, he heard a guitar solo which spoke to him. The lyrics were subliminal. He couldn’t wait to know which song was this and what band made such a poignant track that conveyed so much, in such a simple form.
<p>At the end of the song, the radio jockey muttered in his unmindfulness “This was Pink Floyd, next on track, ladies and gentlemen: Bob Dylan.”</p>
<p>* Hey mister tambourine man … * but he didn’t pay attention to that, he was already lost in thought.<br />
* Pink Floyd. *</p>
<p>He walked down to the nearest record store the other day and asked for Pink Floyd’s latest album. The owner handed him a vinyl record which was packaged with exquisite artwork. It was called, “**The Animals**”. He biked back hurriedly, and listened to the album hoping to hear that solo. Although he couldn’t find the song he was searching for, he loved the album. The lyrical content, the imagery and the psychedelic effects it had!<br /></p>
<p>There was no turning back, my dad was in love with Pink Floyd. For years to come, he collected posters of David Gilmour, impersonated Roger Waters while he remembered every nuance and every guitar riff of the songs.<br /></p>
<p>Later that year, he found out the song he had been searching for, in the album “**The Wall.**” The song was called, “Comfortably Numb”. He lapped up on the songs. He hums, “One of my turns” and “The Trial” till date. He read and scavenged for Pink Floyd. After nearly 8 years of pure fandom, he found a VHS recording of their live concert when he was in college. That was the first time he saw them perform!<br /></p>
<p>Even now, I can assure you, the first Pink Floyd song you’ll hear will most likely is Comfortably Numb but chances are, you’ll listen to one song on Spotify, read up about them on Wikipedia and catch a concert on Youtube, then like it so much that you download their discography and then after 2 days, forget all about it after you find another “awesome band” and not feel connected to this one like my Dad and other kids of that generation did.<br /></p>
<p>Sure, you can find more music and movies than my dad could ever imagine! But then isn’t there some sweetness in scarcity? The sheer madness and absolute fandom is it’s own reward.<br /></p>
<p>You can surely listen to a lot of music and store gazillion songs on your iPod but imagine the joy of standing in queue waiting to get your hands on the new record by Pink Floyd..<br /></p>
<p>That, is special.<br /></p>
- ** Santrupta and Rohan Mishra **.
