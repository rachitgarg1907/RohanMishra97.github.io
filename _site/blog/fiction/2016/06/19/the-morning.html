          <h2> The Morning</h2>
<p>(<i> Romance - 3 minute read </i>)<br />
The man could swear that he heard the train yawn as it pulled up on the station. The slumber seethed through every inch of the metal. It irritated the fuck out of him. The feeling was not unjustified. It was a bright, sunny morning, the first working day of the week. Causality was at play. The entire city seemed to be travelling together, some of them slumped in their seats, trying to catch a few more minutes of precious sleep, ‘got to wear that hangover out’; the ones standing up were either lustily looking for seats or had resigned to their fates and closed their eyes, ‘please lord, can’t afford to sleep on the job, the son of a bitch will fire me’. The stifling claustrophobia made him nauseous as he tried in vain to make some space for himself. Asphyxiation seemed imminent. For the next two hours, his body would be puppet to his fellow passenger’s desire and adjustments for space. He was fighting with his legs for some space when it hit him. His heart skipped a beat and then it skipped one more. The indistinct smell of perfume drifted lazily along the length of the train as the man tried desperately to recollect his senses. Memories flooded his head as it jerked up alert and like a pigeon started looking for the source of that undeniable scent.
She lived in his head even today. A breath of the fresh, mountain air.<br />
  He tried to peer through the collage of limbs. <br />
He could feel her body against him as they embraced. How far they had to hide for a single embrace. Was that her? He squinted.
He was in school again. They were not sitting together, but they looked at each other at the same time, she blinked at him and for the thousandth time, he was awestruck at her beauty, he blinked at her.<br />
No, that was not her. Her hair were magical.<br />
He was writing in his notebook when something knocked against his thigh. He knew what it was. Butterflies invaded his stomach. Ha, we called them flutterflies. The hand knocked against his thigh again and beckoned his. He slipped down his hand and they entwined their fingers together as the flutterflies ate his insides.
Where are you, where are you. He wished he had more eyes. WHERE ARE YOU.
He almost fell on the man in front of him as the train jerked to a stop. This one wasn’t a particularly busy station. A person was walking away from the train.
Those hair.. He could know those hair with his eyes closed. She was walking away. He was sorry. He almost shouted for forgiveness, trying to fight his way through to the open doors.<br />
They slammed shut before he could reach them<br />
