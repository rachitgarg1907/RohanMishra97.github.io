          <h2>Maya and the Pride</h2>
<p>(<i>Social Commentary, 4 minutes</i>)</p>
<p>She looks into the broken piece of mirror, grinning hysterically at her jagged reflection, and contemplating as to where to make her cuts, so that it hurts less….</p>
<p><i>Then</i></p>
<p>Maya enjoyed the crisp morning breeze flowing in from the sea. Living in one of the most sought after houses in Juhu, she thought her life couldn’t get any better. She went over her mental check-list, crossing off items she had accomplished so far.</p>
<p>“Have looks to die for– check”.<br />
“Seduce a rich, successful guy– check”.<br />
“Become a trophy wife– check”.<br />
“Produce a son– check”.</p>
<p>Thinking over the last item, she was grateful that she had to get pregnant only once; pregnancy sure did mar a girl’s figure. But for all her vanity, she couldn’t be more proud of her one and only son, her pride and joy, her little Shlok, who wasn’t so little anymore. Winning the most sought after scholarship to Harvard Business School (yes, his father had no hand in it), he was off to follow his father’s footsteps and join in the family business, that of owning and managing the jewellery company. “All he needs is a suitable bride now” Maya thought. At 22, her son still didn’t have any romantic liaisons, not even an itty-bitty casual little fling. “Well”, she thought to herself, “Obviously, I raised him right, he’s a good little mama’s boy after all.”</p>
<p>Finishing her cup of tea, she considered going over the speech that she had to deliver at the annual LGBTQ parade. Fighting relentlessly for homosexual rights, she knew these antics would put her and her family in media’s good graces. And it did work– the masses and elites alike tagged them as “People’s Champion”. Smiling benignly, she thanked lady luck for working so hard for her, and making things work out in her favour, always.</p>
<p>“Good morning Ma.” her son’s voice drew her out of her musings. Beaming at him, she replied, “A very good morning to you too! All packed and set for Boston? Flight’s tomorrow right?”</p>
<p>“Yes Ma. Just some minute things are left, I’ll go over them in the evening. You seem unusually happy this morning. Pa’s coming back any time soon?”
“Haha, no, sadly. His meeting’s been delayed. Guess he’ll have to suffer the sweltering Delhi heat a bit more.”
“Ah well, I was hoping to meet him one last time before leaving. I had something to tell him”, he paused, before adding, “something to tell both of you actually.”
Hearing his slightly apprehensive tone, she tensed a bit. “What is it my love? You know you can tell me anything right? We always crossed every hurdle easily together, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes Ma, I know, hence I thought I’d say this before leaving, and get it off my chest. And well, it isn’t anything bad, just a slight reveal of sorts. Won’t be really shocking, I promise.”</p>
<p>She waited for him to continue with bated breath.</p>
<p>“Ma, I’m gay, and already am in a long distance relationship with a guy named Sam. He’s partly the reason why I slogged after Harvard. Well, at least I won’t be in a long distance relationship anymore.” he added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>“How long..how long has it been, since you’ve..you’re..you’ve known?” Maya asks.</p>
<p>“About since I guess when I was 13, and well I kissed a girl. Well actually, quite a few girls were kissed after that, and well, I really didn’t feel that spark that usually a normal hormonal boy would feel. It wasn’t until I kissed a guy in a game of truth-and-dare that my suspicions were confirmed. I just swing the other way, I guess.”</p>
<p>“That’s a heavy guess to take son.” Maya replied, a bit too coolly.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just a phrase Ma. I mean, I’m sure I’m gay. In fact, I met Sam twice, in the course of last year. He came all the way from Boston, just for me. He’s great mum. I’ll make sure you meet him, when you visit me in Boston.”<br />
“Okay, okay hold your horses now. Let me just digest the fact that you’re...well..”<br />
“Gay, Ma. And I thought you wrote a whole speech for the pride parade the day after.”<br />
“Well, you see son, it does come as a shock when you discover your one and only son doesn’t like girls!” she scoffed. Taking a deep breath, she added later, “It’s alright, sweetheart, the heart wants what it wants, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh Ma, I’m really sorry”, Shlok said pensively.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, honey, it will be alright” and got up and hugged him tight.</p>
<p><i>Now</i></p>
<p>She looks into the broken piece of mirror, grinning hysterically at her jagged reflection, and contemplating as to where to make her cuts, so that it hurts less.
“Why are you doing this Ma?” Shlok asked, quietly.</p>
<p>“Why do you think so son? ‘Course I can’t let you tarnish the family name now, can I? Do you realise how many losses I’ll be suffering when they discover the company’s only heir is ‘gay’? The society may seem like it has accepted your kind, but truthfully, they still look at you as a filthy plague”, his father puts in. Picking up another piece of the broken mirror, he moved over to the bed, where his son was bound.</p>
<p>“Maya, just stop thinking if this will hurt him or not. If you cannot do it, then just leave and get ready for the parade. You have a ‘speech’ to deliver”, Aakash says the last part with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Oh honey, you really brought this upon yourself.” Giving Shlok a last kiss, she left his room.</p>
<p>A while later, Aakash joins Maya on the foyer, where she was patiently waiting for him, so that they could depart for parade together. “Call the police”, he says, “tell them our son committed suicide. He slit his wrists.”</p>
<p>Right on cue, Maya releases a loud wail and dials 100.</p>
