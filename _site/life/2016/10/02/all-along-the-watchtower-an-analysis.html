          <h3>All Along The Watchtower: An Analysis</h3>
<p>(<i>Life,2 minute read</i>)</p>
<p>Before I start with the article, I want to you ask yourself :
What is the purpose of writing songs or poetry? Is it to preach, or just express yourself.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever have a definitive answer to that, but I can assure to you that I&rsquo;ve heard some music and read some poetry which offer me more context and meaning than complete novels, discourses on philosophies or TED talks. Among such works of art is a song dear to me. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;All Along The Watchtower&rsquo; by Bob Dylan from his rather &lsquo;out-of-the-blue&rsquo; album &lsquo;John Wesley Harding (1967)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While recuperating from a motorcycle accident, Bob Dylan wrote several songs for the album. It can easily be told that John Wesley Harding is his most unique album. Keep in mind that 1967 was the same time when The Beatles came out with &ldquo;Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Band&rdquo; , which was &lsquo;acoustically fulfilling&rsquo; , with extravagant musical pieces and even Dylan said that they were &lsquo;very indulgent&rsquo; . On the other hand this album by Dylan did away with all the epic ballads and was recorded with sparse instrumentations. Dylan calls it the first &lsquo;Biblical Rock Album&rsquo;, which is indeed true not because of the tone of the album but the lyrical content of the album as a whole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the lyrics to &lsquo;All Along The Watchtower&rsquo; :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In6gCrGeZfA"><img alt="lyrics.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q7OzK69S2jl-s3xA3dN5ZVkHtuTiPJYA1qfFp3XNTAnETHJQnzve5NpS2_QQLVeOTkWrxILG2gnhnPhHTSk7tWLLalUbohu1C8TxhMRsU7ynBlg47j56gdQEOQkC6uIpgr2g_mml" style="height:318px; width:566px" /></a></p>

<p>12 sentences, 130 words and a lifetime of deciphering the meanings!</p>

<p>The first thing you can notice is the non-linear nature of the song. It starts in the middle of a conversation, and the last stanza should chronologically be in the first place.</p>

<p>Bob Dylan commented</p>

<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t fulfilled the balladeers&#39;s job. A balladeer can sit down and sing three songs for an hour and a half... it can all unfold to you. These melodies on John Wesley Harding lack this traditional sense of time. As with the third verse of &quot;The Wicked Messenger&quot;, which opens it up, and then the time schedule takes a jump and soon the song becomes wider... The same thing is true of the song &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, which opens up in a slightly different way, in a stranger way, for we have the cycle of events working in a rather reverse order.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower#cite_note-10">[10]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the original album version, the song starts with a high-pitched harmonica and a simple guitar riff which gives the effect of a unfaltering, unwavering force in motion, almost pushing you towards an abyss, with no turning back. This song is the most performed Dylan song in live performances, be it by Dylan , Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Vedder or Lenny Kravitz!</p>

<p><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been a subject of great discussion about the intertextuality of the lyrics and the allusions it makes. The third stanza echoes directly from the Book of Isiah, where the prophet Isiah tells about the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and describes how it&rsquo;s heading to an inevitable doom! There is often a dichotomy of opinions about the identities of the abovementioned &lsquo;Joker&rsquo; and &lsquo;Thief&rsquo; in the song. It is often told that the &lsquo;Joker&rsquo; here is an allusion to Jesus Christ, the son of God,as and when he is about to be crucified. He laments about the misfortunes caused by the ignorance of the people in the Kingdom of God, and the &lsquo;Thief&rsquo; here refers to the thief who was crucified alongside Jesus for thievery. The dialogue between them is a silent commentary on our fool-hardiness and the lightness with which lead our life. Another popular opinion about the allusions is that both the &lsquo;Joker&rsquo; and &lsquo;Thief&rsquo; &nbsp;are both the thieves that were crucified along with Jesus. One of the thieves rebuked the other &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die? We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man (Jesus) hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong.&rdquo;(Luke 23:40, 41). There&rsquo;s also a crazy theory that the Joker here is Dylan himself, for having squandering all his political significance and earning the hatred of the Country Purists by going all electric. The &lsquo;Thief&rsquo; is supposedly Elvis Presley, presumably because he &lsquo;stole&rsquo; the fame and reputation of a predominantly African-American music genre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the opinion that I believe that justify the lyrics of the song are between the two Babylonians in the book of Revelation, one who wants to stay with the falling Empire and one who chooses to adhere to the flow of time and adapts himself, renouncing all old glory and tradition. Now let&rsquo;s breakdown the lyrics and seek to understand it, line by line. Stay with me, things might &lsquo;inevitably&rsquo; go south.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>There must be some way out of here,&rdquo; said the joker to the thief</i></p>

<p>Marking this timeless conversation, is the introduction of the two riders, who are presumably the two approaching riders from the crossroads as said in the final stanza, given that this song has a reverse chronological order. By saying so, the Joker gives us an exposition into the fact that he is trapped in the worldly chaos and nothing makes sense to him anymore. He is seeking a way to &lsquo;escape&rsquo; and &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; , apparently to the Almighty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>There is so much confusion, I can&rsquo;t find no relief&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>He enhances and elaborates the pain that the Joker is going through. By Aristotelian philosophy, this is a classic case of confusion of thought. The joker uses this as a pretext to repent, he is confused by the complicated, convoluted things happening at the Cross, a perfect Babel of tongues. He can&rsquo;t figure out his own moral code and can&rsquo;t determine what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Businessmen drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Businessmen is a rather modern word while Plowmen has a more ancient undertone. Thereby, Dylan lets us know of the timelessness of this song and how the conflict is forever present, irrespective of the time or the people. I personally think that Dylan parodies the strength of God by saying that the &lsquo;wine&rsquo; and &lsquo;earth&rsquo; belongs to &lsquo;me&rsquo;. Therefore, it can be assumed that Joker is none other than the son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>None of them along the line know what any of it is worth&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>tells us that all the wealth and riches of Babylon will be destroyed in a single moment. The businessmen and merchants, who became wealthy by selling her these things, terrified by her great torment. They, including the joker, will weep and cry out to all those standing by as if they were saying so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, this song embodies of the &lsquo;corruption&rsquo; in the morality of the crowds and how traditions, cultures, knowledge, everything gets overturned again and again. The real crisis in life comes when choosing sides, when taking decisions. It questions the very fabric of the Divine and alerts of the inevitable doom we&rsquo;re heading towards! Bob Dylan, a prophet in my opinions, makes us realize that we are to choose our own decision and more values. He asks us to live &#39;authentically&#39; and know that we are going to annhilate, either by war or by a natural disaster. He urges us to grab on to whatever we can and grab it fast. Such is music, or any art for that matter. It entertains us, makes us question everything, teaches us and then enlightens us. If there&#39;s any song which has made you think a lot, let us know and we&#39;ll add it to our playlist!</p>
