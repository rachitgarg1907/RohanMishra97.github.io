          <h2>The Rainy Mood</h2>
<p>(<i> Thriller, 5 minute read</i>)</p>
<p>Waking up from a deep slumber is really a very tedious task. Both your body and mind refuse to accept change, the transition from partial inactivity to the absolute awakened state, or so the mind perceives it to be. The anxiousness to wake up is further enhanced by the weather, when it’s about to rain. The somber and unusual dark confuses the brain into thinking that it’s not the time to wake up.</p>

<p>Looking outside the window, the young man felt a sense of darkness within him, that was not very comforting. After an internal struggle against change, the man finally managed to get on his knees, proceeding to open all time windows, letting the fresh air brush through him and into the house. </p>
<p>His head throbbing, legs half asleep, he readied himself sheepishly for the day ahead. Looking at the mirror, he could see naive eyes, unaware of what life has in store for him. The water, cold and unforgiving helped him, rather uncomfortably in waking up properly, the consciousness slowly awakening and his body properly aware of the surroundings.</p>
<p>It was 6:30 in the morning. The sound of the morning prayer in the temple nearby could be heard half distinctly. Locking the front door of his house, the young man swiftly walked across, unaware of his surroundings, consumed completely in his thoughts, to the bus stop. Reaching there, his mind snapped back to reality and realization stuck him that he was completely wet and it was raining enough to drench a person. He saw the usual inhabitants of the place, an old man of about 60, always with a grim look on his face since his wife died of cancer, the young college girl, with an even grimmer face, as her parents forced her to get engaged at such a young age; the little tea boy, with a surprisingly broad smile on his face. The boy offered him a cup of tea and a clean piece of cloth to dry himself up. On further inquiry about the smile, the young man got to know that the tea boy was going to get financed by an NGO to get proper education. This was oddly enough to make the young man feel a lot better, a sense of happiness enveloping his mind. </p>

<p>The bus arrived. </p>

<p>Getting inside, the man wondered about the absence of one particular young woman, who was almost never late, as she seemed to be very particular about getting things done. Again lost in his thoughts he unconsciously grabbed the seat next to the young girl suddenly noticing that her eyes were soaked, probably because of a fight with her parents. The man contemplated comforting her but decided against it, because his mind constantly bickered him into not saying anything, but the girl looked at him, as if wanting to talk. Not wanting to poke into her personal life, he asked her about the absence of the woman. He proceeded to describe the woman, hoping that she would get what he was talking about, but the puzzled look on her face didn’t change.</p>

<p>The bus stopped, near a cafe.</p>

<p>He decided to go freshen up, feeling very uncomfortable . Excusing himself, he went to the washroom. Near the door, stood the same woman he was describing about a minute before. She held her hand forward, indicating him to come near her.</p>

<p>The bus driver started honking the horn. He somehow knew that the bus was important, that he was meant to go away in it.<br />
Yet, he was deeply drawn to this woman. It didn't feel right going towards her, he felt threatened. Still, somewhere inside he felt, it was the right thing to do. The eyes of the woman were too familiar for them to be those of a stranger. </p>

<p>He slowly walked to her and held her hand. She walked him towards a mirror very slowly. Standing in front of the mirror, he couldn’t believe what he saw. The place where he’s supposed to stand in the mirror, there was nothing. He looked to the right, towards the woman, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>“Wake up. It’s time to go home.”</p>

<p>He started losing consciousness, he felt someone pushing him hard.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes, he saw himself in some kind of raised bed. Not being able to move his arms or legs, he looked forward. He saw the woman in his dreams, with her head on his abdomen, crying.<br /> 
His torso was wet with tears, body stitched up. <br />
Realization hit him.<br />
He was home.</p>
