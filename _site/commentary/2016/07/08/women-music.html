          <h2>Objectifying Women in Music</h2>
<p>(<i>Commentary, 6 minute read</i>)</p>
<p>It was another usual Delhi’s hot summer day and I was out on a drive with my father. I turned on the FM radio. “<i>Mere photo ko seene se yaar…... main to tandoori murgi hu…..</i>”
“Change the channel. What nonsense are they playing. I don’t understand what has happened to this generation’s taste in music,” he said.</p>
<p>Another channel played “<i>blue eyes….choti dress me bomb lagdi…</i>”. Filled with disgust, I turned off the FM.</p>
<p>I am not very fond of music myself. Most of the times, I find myself trying to look for reasons to dislike it even more so that I do not have to listen to it much. Most of my friends literally survive on music. I do not get this idea much. Well, personal choices do vary from person to person. I remember how my friends used to tease me when I would talk to them about a latest song because that song was never latest by the time it fell into my ears.</p>
<p>I have been feeling this upsurge to express my disgust and displeasure on this for a long time now.</p>
<p>One fine day, I was listening to a song named “brown rang” by the apparent Rap God - Mr. Yo Yo Honey Singh. I am so glad that this song grabbed my attention and I started respecting him. I realised how beneficial this man was to the Indian society that tends to judge the girls based on their appearance. The song starts with telling the girls that their “dusky complexion” is something that is the most sought after aspect in them and they should not worry that they are not “fair”. He moves on and even tells them that these days, boys do not like “fair girls”. He further goes on to explain other aspects of their looks and dressing sense. This song is definitely an “eye opener” for our society and would help in eradicating racism. Great job done, Mr. Singh.</p>
<p>Women have been seen as a plaything and not even a living thing that could have her own existence, an object that would provide pleasure to men. Their bodies have been made a subject to base the songs on. Most of the songs that top the playlists these days are what we call “item songs”. Bollywood has never been very kind to women and has played a major role in establishing gender biases and gender roles in the modern world. And with the increasing trend of item songs these days, this problem is aggravating. Moreover, we listen to such crap while turning the volume higher up and shouting and singing our lungs out. We don’t bother about this problem for even a second.
Hypocrisy is a major feature of mankind. One day, I find all those high profile feminists protesting against something that they feel is derogatory to women. I am happy when I see them raising this issue against such songs. But, the very next day, I am extremely disappointed when I watch the news channels and find them dancing on such songs in a party held the previous night.</p>
<p>I do not find these songs “entertaining” at all. But these are the ones that grab the most attention. They help the musicians (as they call themselves) to gain monetary profits and hence they continue to compose such filthy songs. We are encouraging these people to continue insulting women by using such derogatory and callous terms. This reflects their mediocre mindsets. But this situation will not change until we stand against them. It is really important that our society begins to understand what is good for its growth and what is not.</p>
